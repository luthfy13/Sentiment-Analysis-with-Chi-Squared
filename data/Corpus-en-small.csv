"I Thought It Was Laughable But...: A cool strong woman in Jada Pinkett Smith. A horror show that tackles religious themes. William Sadler (for me, that's a done deal) as the hero.

"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES: This is one of the best movies ever. The cast stands out in this movie about a women's baseball leaue during WW2.

A must..",Positif

"my wife loves it: She loves the way it smells, and it also actually works better as a shave gel than any other I've tried.

Read the original first...: After all of the film and tv adaptations of this novel over the last 90 or so years it was good to finally enjoy the original version.

IE ""next we dunk,dunk,dunk the dishes.."" but I just read it one time and its fine. Cute book.",Positif
All in all a good read.: The main problem I had with this book is Julie. She was definitely not the sharpest tack in the box if after 8 years of marriage she hadn't figured out what hubby was like! She was also way too obsessed with her appearance.I loved Mac & the scenes of him in drag were a scream!,Positif
"Angel: Several people have written that they feel the book is unfinished. It is the third in the line of books about Max and the other flying ""kids"".

Great case: I've built three computers for family using this case and they all love it. A bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height.

"The ""Citizen Kane"" of Canadian Frat Movies: Just like my title said, this movie is the ""Citizen Kane"" of Canadian Frat Movies.

Suhrhold deck Brush: My latest purchase of the Shurhold brush head is a replacement for one that I have had for twenty five years. It is the only brush I will use on my car as it is soft enough not to scratch the paint. The old brush is reserved for cleaning the garage floor. It is still useable after 25 years.,Positif
Canon camera case review: The case is made of high quality material and fits my Canon powershot A700 perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars if the case had a seperate compartment for carrying an extra set of batteries. There is just enough room to carry the camera and an extra memory chip. No extra batteries.,Positif
"Rousing, historically-based tale of English in India: Wonderful, rousing, and educational - you have to read this with a bookmark in the footnotes section, and you'll probably enjoy doing so - the historical research Fraser does is astounding, and exposes much of the hypocrisy of John Company's stay in ""Indja"".",Positif
"Overall a good game: Overall this was a good game, not quite long enough, but a good game. The levels are fun and interesting to play. Some of the areas you visit are breathtaking, especially if you have a high end computer system. I just wish the game was longer and hope they make a sequel to finish the story.",Positif
"Blaze got power but not the style.: This is a dark album, and I don't say it for the color. You'll love songs like ""Sign of the cross"" and ""Man on the edge""... But blaze is not exactly what you think.His voice is deeply annoying sometime, but is excellent. THis album deserves a looking.You won't be dissapointed",Positif
"A country ravaged by centuries of war: This is a great history of Afghanistan, easily written for those who do not lknow much about the area.

"Sublime living, dreaming, and reading!: This is one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in a while. It is light yet engaging, funny yet poignant. I felt as though I was sailing the Caribbean on the adventure of my dreams... An Embarrassment of Mangoes elicited dreams of ""someday..."" Simply outstanding.",Positif
"Very handy: This reel takes most of the hassle out of managing electrical cords. If there were a way to feed the plug out of the hub, like a garden hose reel, the product would be near perfect. A hook to hang the device from a wall would be nice, also. Anyone who handles electric cords should have one of these.",Positif
"Provides good examples of successful mail order campaigns.: A good historical review of successful mail order campaigns. Contains a lot of print advertising examples with some background information about the sales it generated and the company behind it. Does not really spend a lot of time showing you ""How to"".",Positif
"41 Original Hits From The Soundtrack Of American Graffiti: This is a great soundtrack, my parents have this soundtrack on records. As a kid I use to listen to them constantly.

"Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together.

Dude!!! Sweet!!!: This movie is SOOO funny!!! It's about these 2 party dudes trying to find their car in order to get their girlfriend's anniversery gifts in order to recieve 'special treats.'

"there's nothing better than live rolling stones: i own three rolling stones albums now, but there's nothing like listening to them live on cd. there are two new studio tracks on the cd. at first, i thought they had covered ""sex drive"" by twisted sister and w.a.s.p., but a closer listen brung up different lyrics.",Positif
"COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!: I thought this CD was sooooo cool. At first, i didn;t think I'd like it becuase I'm a pretty big BSB/NSync/98 degrees/5ive fan, but I thought I'd give it a try. Woah! I was blown away! The tracks are cool, the lyrics are cool, Destiny's Child is cool! You've gotta get it!",Positif
"EMDR: This is a must have book for those using EMDR, particularly if you are new at the process. This would be the second book to buy after the basic text.

Krames Provides a Quality Read on Rumsfeld: I liked the way the book was organized. It distills Rumsfeld into an understandable person with recognizable leadership principles and skills.

Altec Lansing XT2 Speakers: Heard about these speakers on XM Radio and decided to buy and try them. When I got them was surprised at how easy to connect and the sound. Sound is just Fantastic. My laptop never sounded so good with all the music I have downloaded. Recommend these to anyone useing a laptop at home.,Positif
"Good book, but a little hard to keep up with.: This is a good book for beginners, but the tape does move quickly. Additionally, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for short trips because learning phrases (at least for me) worked a lot better. But for a general intro to the language, this provides a nice base.",Positif
"Eyewitness Books are the BEST!: Eyewitness vividly explains the life and times of those ""knights in shining armor"". These books not only hold the short attention span of young children, they thoroughly engross adults as well! Eyewitness gives the most complete information in the most interesting format - ALWAYS!",Positif
"More than just a story about a trial...: This film provides a clear and concise overview of the incident and the trial, but it is also a revealing look at the Intelligent Design movement. It shows the truth about the origins of the movement in addition to explaining the problems with the ""theory"" and its claims.",Positif
"Good But Violent: I liked this book a lot but I thought it was very violent like when the teenagers were hacking each other to death with hatchets and I didn't like the fact that Robin Fear kills all the people for like no reason at all. Well,if you like Horrer then you will most likely like it. Hope this helps!",Positif
Super for my Xmas project!: I don't have a mantel but do have a floor to ceiling wall of brick for my fireplace.

Dune: This is my favorite novel of all time. I have read and re-read it since I was a teenager. Frank Herbert was an absolute genius. Science fiction is not usually my favorite genre of reading but this is the exception. I have the entire collection of Dune books including the rare Dune Encyclopedia. A must read!,Positif
"Not the best book ever, but it is up there.: This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.",Positif
"Not great but is okay: All right, Adjust well on the bike, however I think the original has a best presentation and even better fit, I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with this device and it is too early to assess its performance, is currently installed and working well in general I have no complaints.",Positif
"Great Cat: The catalytic converter did not look new like the picture you see on amazon. It looked a little faded due to shelf life or something but, I did fit perfectly and my car is a lot more fuel efficient. No problems yet and I doubt that there will be because magnaflow is a great company with great products!",Positif
"This book rocks!: The authors have a refreshing collective voice, and it's so great to finally be encouraged, rather than be told the usual statistic, 'only 30% of women have orgasms-- you should just be content as you are.' I am so thankful that I found this book by chance; I'm buying copies for friends already.",Positif
"awesome!!!: My daughter learned all of her letters and their sounds within 1 week. She loved the video and watched it over and over. She wants to play word games all the time now. I think even as a parent it is one of the least annoying videos to have playing in the background, it was awesome for in the car too!!",Positif
"Good movie minus the pornography: Let's just call it what it is, most modern movies are basically pornographic because we've become desensitized and don't value sex anymore. That said, this is a great little movie and at least shows the consequences of promiscuous sex, unlike most American films which glorify it.",Positif
"THIS BOOK IS HOT !! SIDESPLITTING !!: This tome was worth it !! A must read, to encourage anyone to press on, despite the person in your life. No matter what they do to you.

"Great Stanley tradition: Great album with only a couple of minor low points. Not bad for a 2 CD set. You more than get your moneys worth...

"unusual: Fargo manages to take very dark subject matter, make it humourous at times, all the while maintaining a sense of realism. The characters are really what make this movie; they are quirky and entertaining. Great acting; William H. Macy stands out. A definite departure from the ordinary, highly recommended.",Positif
"Incredible Little Pan: This pan is the perfect small frying pan. It's thick bottom heats evenly and the nonstick surface in very durable.

"Fantastic product: For some reason, wireless routers do not work in my home. I've tried several brands and none seem to really work. The Panasonic system does the trick. I can get Internet anywhere in my house now. I was thinking about running wires through the house, but with a couple adapters, there is no need.",Positif
"pretty good: Pretty good tie storage, the other reviewers are right though, 4 ties per slot is pushing it. If your ties are thick or long (mine are both) you're really only going to get 3 per slot so 9 total. Still, it's well made and smells really nice. I just ordered a second one so I'll be covered for a while.",Positif
SUPERB LITTLE WONDER: IT'S AN AMAZING FLASHLIGHT FOR THE SIZE. IT HAS THE LITE INTENSITY OF A ORDINARY TWIN D-CELL FASHLIGHT AND WILL LAST EVEN LONGER.

"A quiet workhorse!: Bought this and just to test if I would keep it, I printed a huge database file of 16,000 pages which took me almost 20 hours between personal breaks and only five cartridges.

"Spans the Generations of Marvel Characters: A great gift for Marvel readers and a coffee table book for Marvel Families. This book brings back memories and provides helpful chronology. In the sixties, Iron Man was yellow, the X-Men were blue and yellow, and Daredevil was black and yellow. Marvel sure liked yellow.",Positif
THE favorite book in our house.: We love reading this book to our six month old. It has a rhythm to it that makes it so much fun. The illustrations are adorable and the story-line is very creative. The cardboard books are best for a young baby who likes to turn the pages too.I give this book as gifts all the time.,Positif
"Perfect-sized Bible: I bought this Bible as a gift, and I was completely thrilled with it. It is small enough to carry with you but large enough for at home study. The print was larger than I expected, and the pages were not too thin. The cover work was very nicely done; my friend was very pleased with this Bible!",Positif
"Love This Mat: This mat is perfect for me. The 10mm thickness provides the cushion that I need for my ankles, back, and knees. I also love that it is decomposable, recyclable, does not absorb moisture, is toxic-free, hypoallergenic, and wipes clean with a mild solution of soap and water. Very much worth the price.",Positif
"Good reference material: This book was great for what I wanted it for, being a film student I felt it would be nice to have something to look back at anytime I forgot something when I am done with school. This book is a good source for a reference for refreshing your self or for learning something you didn't know!",Positif
"fitful: I think most of this movie is mediocre at best. It's contrived, formulaic, poorly written and acted. But, the half-hour of slapstick when the burglars are trying to break into the home is SO hilarious, it's worth sitting through the other parts. It's really a hilarious half hour. So, that's a mixed review!",Positif
"Great toys with squeakers: This 3 pack is pretty good. I have a 5 lb. Yorkie and he doesnt care much for the 3 squeaking mini tennis balls but wow, he goes NUTS for the tiny bear with the squeaker (+ replacement squeaker). Absolutely nuts, crazier than when he gets pigs ears as treats. Pretty good product overall.",Positif
"Better than being there: This video only has one DTS encoded track (bonus)and any of the other cuts would make it worth buying. From ""Take It Easy"" to ""New York Minute"" the concert takes were clean, tight and amazing to watch. My only disappointment is that they left off ""Lying Eyes"". Maybe they'll record another!",Positif
"Another edition of the timeless book: I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift.",Positif
"This book is a good buy.: Tom Clancy is at it again, but he takes a break from Jack Ryan and concentrates only on the team of Clark and Chavez. I loved these guys as a team in Debt of Honor. I think, however, it's better that they stay only part of the plot. Still, although different, Rainbow Six is a great novel.",Positif

We never could agree. :-) This movie is intriguing and will keep you guessing on the conclusion. One of my most favorite movies.",Positif
A Legend: This album along with all of the others is fantastic.

Find out why his fan club includes such greats as Paul Simon. This man is the real deal.,Positif
"one of the better seasons: i thought the series decreased in quality and enjoyability a bit over seasons 2 and 3, even though it was still worth watching, but season 4 took it back up a notch. anybody who enjoyed this series at all will be very likely to be pleased with season 4. i am sorry to see this series end.",Positif
"Led Zeppelin, it's better than sex: magic, no band will ever come close to the long guitar solos by jimmy page, of the gut busting bass solos by none other than John Paul Jones. i mean if you don't like them you can go to mexico or something. rid us of your stupidness. all in all, zeppelin kicks ass, end of story.",Positif
One of the best book I have ever read: I'm 18 and I don't read lot and I was waiting to read Emma. So I read Pride and Prejudice.I think it's a great book.

"Nice Mat: This mat is very comfortable and has just the right tackiness to prevent sliding duing yoga postures.

Overall, I would highly recommend this mat or another similar mat from the same company.",Positif
"U will never read anything like it: I read One Hudred Years of SOlitude like 6 times over the years, and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre. Just an unbelievable classic.

Very Fun Racing Game: Roadsters is one of those games that plays like an arcade racer but has real licensed cars. Both the graphics and the play control are very good and the cars are definetly cool. My only complaint was that there wasnt enough tracks. There are only 6 of them and after a while you just want more.,Positif
"Sweet and funny, though completely predictable: This movie is not going to shock you with it's ending or offer you a new twist on the same old romcoms of the past. It is a quintessential romcom, but it's so very worth your time. It's very funny; I like all the actors in it, and it's just a fun, light-hearted movie.",Positif
"Adoption message: This is a fun, wholesome movie. It also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children. Even if children aren't adopted, they will certainly meet others who are. This movie presents adoption in a positive light, an attitude which I believe even young children can begin to emulate.",Positif
"Great Entertainment: We bought this for my 2 month old daughter because she loves my parents fish tank. At first she wasn't all that intested in it, but now she loves it.

Restoring Your Degestive Health: Love this book and Love Dr. Brasco -- just recently acquired him as a physician was so awesome to have a physician PERSONALLY call you when you're having issues instead of office help -- doesn't happen much anymore -- I learned alot from talking to him personally and from this book.,Positif
"Highly recommended!: This is a very easy system to learn, still it's among the most powerful and profitable systems ever created.

Listen for the music; it's hauntingly beautiful.",Positif

A very funny book.: I think this is a great book to read. I enjoyed it a lot. Kids should read this book because it is funny when Matilda uses her powers.

Two Great Family Films: This is the absolute best print of The Little Princess staring Shirley Temple. The print of Heidi is also superb. The Heidi stars Maximilian Schell and Jene Simmons.

"Strange and stranger!: Klinger's 19th century etchings are Freudian dreams and his superior body of work is the link between the 18th century etchings of Goya and the 20th century art of Dali, de Chirico, Hitchcock and Rod Sterling.

The Creation of the World: A mixture of George Gershwin and Brazilian classical music directed by one of the great symphony maestros of the 20th century. Sounds classical but more in line with Aaron Copland's ability to take folk music and give it a big sound rather than the atonal qualities of most modern composers.,Positif
Dear Kathy: I had heard Ms Kelly speak in public in my town. Afterward I knew that I wanted to have her words to savor.

The regular 874 pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available. The only thing I don't like is they attract lint a little too much.",Positif
"Always a pleasure: Watched the movie 10 or so times before reading the book. Just finished second reading. The humanity of it is so engaging. Misunderstandings and assumptions abound. People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up. How true in our lives as well, making the outcome even more satisfactory.",Positif
"Running Blind (Jack Reacher No. 4): I thought the ending was a bit ""flat"" compared to the first three Jack Reacher books.

Great Movie: I really love this movie. I watched about 3 times back to back. I like Kelly Preston because even though she was pretty...she definitely had a cute little potty mouth.

"This is a bargain!: Western with lots of cool characters, lines and stunts.The lead character is based on an Eastwood character, but does okay.

Great: Love this thing and it works great. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when I got it it came with NO bag like the other reviewer got and it wasn't in the box.

"Fun Read!: This book was really fun. It was action-packed. The beginning was a little odd, at least to me, but the rest of the story kept me interested.Since it's an older story, it's really great for adults like me who love ""old-school"" sci-fi.

"Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state.

They don't make great classic movies like this any more !!!: Trail Of Robin Hood is a great movie with Roy Rogers and my favorite actresses is Penny Edwards.

EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA! EVITA!: All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable. If I could change one thing it would be Jonathan Pryce because he has an annoying voice.,Positif
"Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!: If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a ""must have"" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!",Positif
"Great classic, many unreadable subtitles: This film deserves the excellent reputation it has earned. However the version I purchased (International Film Series) has white subtitles against white backgrounds. Only about 60% are fully readable. Other releases may have the same problem. Do not buy this unless you speak French.",Positif
"My Philips Norelco Epilator: I was really pleased after using my new epilator, it definitely exceeded my expectations and I don't need to epilate again for at least a month easily. I had a Braun epilator earlier I had used for years which was much more expensive but I must say the Philips epilator is as good, if not better.",Positif
Christmas Classics: This is a cute classic movie set and each disc has the main feature but then a another movie or two on it as well. I knew what I needed to order (I borrowed the box set but I broke one disc so I had to replace the whole thing). This was the cheapest place I found it. The set arrived very quickly. Thanks!,Positif
"Absolutely terrific ! 1: LOVED IT ! What a great story. Gabe and Kelsey are great together. Both strong and gentle. Suspenseful to the very end. This story has it all, passions that sizzles, suspense that hold you and characters that make to you love them or HATE them, there is no in between. Read it and try to put it down.",Positif
"One of my favorite love stories: I was able to see this movie in high definition ON DEMAND USING XFINITY/COMCAST. The picture quality was equal to a Blu ray, however is was full screen.

"The bible of homebrewing: If your interested in homebrewing, this book is the place to start. I've read it cover to cover several times over the years and have used it as reference many times.

"Lots of information: This book is great for including the many different ways families come together. Adoption, step-parents, single parents and other types of families are included. This book is very inclusive and leaves room for all situations.It is full of facts for helping to explain how babies are made to our children.",Positif
"one heck of a rollercoaster ride: I had to read this book for College English and I couldn't put it down. Intertwining three strands, one for each character, into a braid is a great metaphor. The fact that the same events were told in different views was incredible. I liked the fact that it was written backwards. Good book!",Positif
"WOW...now this is how folk elements shoould be modernized: This is simply a beautiful album along side all the other releases of Kismet; North Atlantic Baltic Express, and Dreaming...all three albums are brilliant fuse of electronic elements with hard rock/alternative and macedonian folk music....You will enjoy it for sure.",Positif
I love Plaza Sesamo: The video is exactly like Sesame Street in english the program is great for introducing new vocabulary and understanding the words in Spanish. I bought this for my five year old son. Although I recommend getting the alphabet because knowing the sounds of each letter is important in Spanish pronuncation.,Positif
"My Favorite So Far.: The Pyramids Of Mars is my favorite Doctor Who episode. This is my favorite Wells adaptation to date. A freakish, fantastical telling of the Martian invasion that destroyed humanity at the turn of the century. Praise for supplying me with adult wit and dialogue and keeping to Wells' words and intention.",Positif
"Five stars on my list of children videos: This is an amazing video for young children and adults alike. It teaches the six pillars of characetristics in an easy way. In each pillar there is a skit to go along with each pillar, which makes it easier for the children to understand. I would recommand this video to all parents.",Positif
"A cherished memory.: After seeing the original TV special, I was compelled to buy the album and promptly wore it out. What a joy to find it's on CD. Hard to not enjoy the delight and whimsy of the late Jim Henson and John Denver in this wonderful album. My only regret is that the video of the original show is not available.",Positif
Nice little set of speakers: These were a pleasent surprise for the price. They are nice and compact which is what we were looking for to put on a kitchen counter. Yet they provide very rich sound for two small speakers.They only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is nowhere to set an MP3 player on the system.,Positif
"Night: I have been reading the books from the Oprah book club for a few years now and usually enjoy them. This one was exceptional!Maybe because it is a true story. It is horrifying, yet hard to put down.Not a real long book, so you can read it cover to cover in a short amount of time.I personal thought it was a great book.",Positif
"We do like kent: Yes. this is like good music...swedish music, with english lyrics, ..weird, but better than most bands who plays bad music. I would say, the main difference between those other bad bands and Kent-the good band is that Kent makes pretty good music that feels good listening to, and that's what music is about.",Positif
"Well written book: This book explores the best and worst of human nature in people, when they are at their highest and when they are at their lowest points in life. Marner also writes about the good nature in others that can develop after ones worst moments in life. I really enjoyed this book and hope others will to.-Tipcat",Positif
Works good!: My boyfriend is a drummer and he's really hard on his sticks. AND despite the fact that he's an amazing drummer he's still really clumsy..hence his sticks flying out of his hands in the middle of a gnarly breakdown... these sticks help him from throwing them at his bandmates and helps protect the sticks aswell!,Positif
Nice Slides From Amazon: I'll start out by saying that I've read a lot of reviews on these slides. Everybody complaining about the packaging! I think the packaging is just fine! I bought the slides not the way their packaged. The slides are high quality and very nice to use. I'm satisfied and think their a quality product!!,Positif
"Beautiful Women and Well Staged Killings: Tenebre is the kind of movie that will keep you guessing until the very end.The killings are done with style and gore and unlike the horror movies of today, the plot is not an afterthought.So if you like a slasher movie that will actually make sense of the violence then see Tenebre.",Positif
"Rocks. Best. Get it.: Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also, this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too.",Positif
"Dean -- Send me your address: Dean -- Love the book -- especially the pictures of Gavin and me -- but you know that.

"Best Book on VB.NET I've Found: This is far and away the best book I've found on VB.NET.

Highly recommended!",Positif
"A kitchen staple: I love this pan. I use it practically every day. We received one for our marriage, and, after 20 years, I finally had to replace it. (A second one we received a few years later is still holding up beautifully.) The pan is the perfect size for a can of soup or vegetables or a gravy mix. I absolutely love it!",Positif
"Fame is so important: It is not really my sort of movie, but it turned out to be a real winner. It is a story of a woman who wants to be famous at all costs. She ends out having her husband murdered and then... Overall it made me think.I thought it was well acted particularly by Kidman. The film was well filmed.Worth seeing.",Positif
"So cute!: This hat is honestly one of the very cutest things I have bought for my daughter thus far.

No fading, fraying, shrinking, or pilling.Super cute!",Positif
Audubon Society Field Guides: Audubon Society Field Guides make great gifts for children and adults. I often give the books as gifts along with bird houses and bug houses. I always make sure that everyone knows that they should never kill any wildlife that is outside in our big world. I love my own collection of these books.,Positif
Uplifting and Inspirational!: I purchased the CD as a means of introduction for our kids to christian music. The worship songs are upbeat and spiritually uplifting.

"Sweet and depraverd: Saint Reverend Jen, partron saint of the uncool, makes the Lower East Side, tenement to the world, seem like shangrila. She has a way of making the depraved seem sweet and the bizarre seem like common sense. This guide may not tell you what beds Washington slept in, but it may tell you what beds you can.",Positif
"good headphones: I use these headphones with my clix 2 and not many complaints here. The cord is kind of long but I can deal with it. Decent sound. The only caution that I give is to avoid turning on the headphones while wearing them and music is playing. Also, when batteries start to go it can cause some weird, loud noises.",Positif
"Its as the picture shows, not what the description is!: When I got the item, it is what the picture shows (4 of the #4 containers) I didn't mind, because its what I actually wanted.

"Great book!!!: We have been able to access information on the Israel-Palestine conflict from the media. However, the readily-available information seemed one-sided, with the other side always being branded as the 'evil' side or 'terrorists'. This book shows the conflict from the Palestinian point of view, which is very rare.",Positif
"Excellent condition, fast delivery!: Just as the title says, I received this item just a few short days after I ordered it and was able to take it with me on a trip. I never thought it would show up so quickly. The condition of the book was excellent, new and unused. I am very happy with my order and will defiantly buy more.",Positif
"Great circulation: I have this fan in my room at night. It really helps keep the room cool. I have a window a/c unit but the fan on that doesn't circulate the air. This is a powerful unit. It works effectively on low in a bedroom. I also have the HT 900 model, which is the updated version but it is not as good as the HT 800.",Positif
"Definately an eye opener!: This book is an excellent resource for those who want more information about SV40. It is ridiculous that the government sat on this info and because of it, people are dying from cancer. The book is not written in a conspiracy theory type of way. Very factual information given. Kudos to the authors!",Positif
"Better than most: Out 18 month old dog typically chews toys into pieces in < a minute, thus although he got inside on one edge within 10 minutes, the toy kept going for days. Thus, although not the long lasting toy I want/need, it has held up better than most. Our had two squeakers and he loves finder them and crushing them.",Positif
Excellent Entry Level Laser Printer: If you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executive's office this is perfect. It is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.,Positif
"Great Movie, But...: The storyline was superb. Rupert was great. But Madonna...what were you thinking??? Her accent annoyed me throughout the whole movie. Is she American??? Is she English??? The cross between sounds Australian which is irritating. Apart from Madonna's terrible acting, this movie is held together pretty well.",Positif
"Fantasy Master: One of the best fantasy novels ever. Many have already outlined why this is such a masterful story, so I won't replicate that effort.I enjoyed this book as a young grade schooler and plan to re-read it again and again. This is the kind of book you want to read out loud to your grandchild and to the kid in you.",Positif
"Thank God there's a place ""ware"" I can find this on CD: Great album from great singer.

In almost no time the disco-ish ""What's Your Name"" became one of my very favorite songs.",Positif
"Captured Live!!: NRBQ have released a few live recordings but this one seems to capture the band's comraderie. They are having fun and so is the audience. Everything seems spontaneous yet well coordinated. They are a fun, cohesive band. This disc is a blast! I've worn out my cassette and am purchasing the CD!! Thanks Uncle Q!",Positif
"Excellent: I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it, bringing up nostalga. It is not a four star (1 1/2) movie for many more than myself. I was excited to have found it and now own it. Thanks.",Positif
"The Consummate Traveller: Just when I think I've written a great travel story, I go read Palin and remind myself how it's done. I just love his incredibly obtuse descriptions and attention to unimportant detail. To read this, or any of his books, is to travel side-by-side with Palin as if a companion. I raise my glass to you.",Positif
"Incredible energy: I don't know how Jimmy Sturr does it. CD after CD, the energy level is amazing. He always includes a cajun number or two, in this case Cajun Fiddle, and a country track, this time Big Ball's in Cowtown. He's so prolific that, on track 12, he tells he Can't Afford to Be a Star. I hope that's not true, Jimmy.",Positif
Great memories: I was lucky enough to see this great play on broadway many years ago and owned the LP. Needed to upgrade my music collection to more modern times (AKA CD) The story is still so true in today's society so the music was still very enjoyable. We lost a great composer and singer with the passing of Anthony Newley.,Positif
The Five Pennies: A rather more different production to feature Danny Kaye but his talents are ably displayed as he portrays a musician and father. Be prepared for some sad parts but many aspects of the story ring true to life. Lots of great music and the scenes with Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong together are cinematic gold.,Positif
"Most Useful: This has become one of my most valued counseling companions. For those of you who are familiar with Glasser's Choice Theory, this is a great look into his actual practice techniques as he relates real case studies he has lead and how he has applied CT in real-life situations.Great read as well as a super resource.",Positif
"Rockin' Scandinavians: I heard this group on the radio and had to have their cd, which I like very much. My only disappointment is that my favorite track, Sinklars vise, is incomplete. The singer is cut off midsentence and it was a longer song on the radio. Even though I can't understand the words, the rhythms are mesmerizing.",Positif
"Review for Of Mice and Men: Of Mice an Men is a great novel. It sends you back in time to the Great Depression era of the 1930's. It is a good book for middle school students. The reason I gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book. Except for the language, this book is a great book to read.",Positif
best r&b album of the year: I was never much of an r and b fan till i heard this album. R. Kelly is an amazing artist and this is his best work yet. There are very few album where i can listen to every song from start to finish but this is one of them. If you have any doubts about getting this album BUY IT. you wont regret it.,Positif
"Perfect!: We received this as a wedding gift. Three years later it looks like new! It cleans easily, cooks wonderfully, and has a great weight to it. I've never had a teflon pan last so long without any signs of wear or tear. This is probably the wedding gift we have used more than all others, and I couldn't be more satisfied.",Positif
"A Children's Classic: Blessedly devoid of adult humor and sexual inuendo, Sleeping Beauty pits good against evil, and good wins. Intricate background scenery, silly fairies, and wonderful singing highlight this classic fairy tale. Is it a realistic picture of life as a medieval princess? Of course not. It's not supposed to be.",Positif
"Feeling Mellow: This is a great CD when you're feeling mellow or slightly sad. Nonetheless, the lyrics still have bite, which keeps it one step above the rest. It doesn't push, but is very subtle and understated. For this reason it lives on as a classic, after all the other fads of music have passed on by. You have to hear it.",Positif
"Great book for young children: This is a great little book for working with young children, who have a hard time talking about their feelings. The removeable stickers allow for the child to interact and express their own feelings over and over again. I also have enjoyed other books in this series that deal with other emotions.",Positif
"A magic book made me feel like microwave do: I got this biik from my teacher in ISU and have kept it dusted for nearly 2 years.

"The best book I've ever read: This may be the biggest book I've ever read but once I started, I couldn't put it down. Gary Jennings is a terrific writer and I am fortunate to have stumbled on his best work. The sequel Aztec Autumn in OK but not quite as good as Aztec. I would recommend this book to anyone with no reservations.",Positif
"Great action score in need of better album.: I love the music and sound quality of this score, but the album is so short, and so many of the action cues are present, it makes the entire thing seem one-note. There's not much in terms of variety like with the Mummy scores, but this is still worth a listen -- a short, fun listen.",Positif
"Awesome Book.: I just finished reading this book and I would have given it 5 stars but I felt that the series was entirely too short. I think the ""ghost writer"" is doing a wonderful job. I wish that there was one more for this series. I have read all V.C. Andrews book and I found that the writer is just growing with the times.",Positif

Very cute set but..: This is a really cute set with lids but there is no proper packaging for this at all. Buyer has no protective bubble wrap or wrapping paper. Received 2 ceramic bowls (half the set) that were completely cracked and broken and unusable. Why not take some time to properly package these delicate ceramic bowls.,Positif
"McCoy Gives justice to the compositions of Burt Bacharach: I thought this was a wonderful calaboration of song writer and musician. Both are top quality, and the combination is dinamite. True, the record seems a bit sappy at times and over sentimental, but is a wonderful departure from McCoy's more familiar work with Coltrane.",Positif
Old and New World co-exist: This movie was a delight to watch. It's simple presentation of tradition and the power it holds trying to bond with the here and now.

"As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.: I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's.

I love this movie: Johnny Depp is amazing in this movie. It always makes me laugh and cry no matter how many times i have seen it.

"must read: A great book. A must read for someone who likes historical fiction. The characters come alive and the action is plenty.

Mine was enthralled the whole time.",Positif

"Great series and wonderful actress!: Anyone who hasnt seen this series is missing out big time. The sets, costumes, acting are superb!

Mother of a 3 and 4 yr old girls: Both my girls loved this toy. I needed something to keep them busy when I went out of town and I bought this toy and they spent hours playing together with this set. What I like most about it is all the stuff that comes with it fits inside of it and it is easy for them to clean up on their own.,Positif
"Worth the price of admission: I dont know how anyone could not laugh at this movie. It seems to appeal to all types of audiences that enjoy light humor. I wasnt a fan of Ben Stiller until this move. He is very funny in it. Despite the focus on humor, it is not entirely predictable and has some suprises in store for the audience.",Positif
When Movies were More Fun: I had recorded this movie originally off of TV years ago. It is in my opinion one of the classics and it brought back plenty of memories. What I really appreciated with this DVD is that it included the viewer to watch the film at it was originally intented. It's definitely worth the price of admission.,Positif
"I'm stunned there is no US DVD...great film: Can it be that the only DVD edition of this is for non-US countries? I think this film is brilliant.

"No movie can match the beauty of the original book: If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process.",Positif
A Must For Every Generation: This is a time honored classic of a boy and the incredable bond he and his dog share.

A classic to pass from generation to generation.,Positif

"Best lube ever!: This lube is great for any purpose. My wife and I love it. What makes it perfect is it isn't sticky at all, in fact you could kind of compare it to lotion in the fact that it kind of just disopears on its own over time. It isn't a sticky mess like other lubes. But it is still very slippery and lasts a long time.",Positif
With this album The Ox proved he could stand on his own.: What a great CD. Pete Townshend could not have written such hard rocking songs that have such a weird since of humor.

"Possibly the most depressing ending ever: I'll make this short.This was a short, quickly read book and a very worth while read. The old man is very admirable.I enjoyed the book and understood why it had to end the way it did but still left me feeling like some one had punched me in the stomach.Read it, it was good but depressing.",Positif
"A Mental Refresher: The book is small, yet, it is filled with mountains of self-help jewels. It is mind boggling at first, but, it is truth simplysaid. James Allen little book was so helpful to me I read it more than once. It is good reading and helpful advice. A real mental refresher. Once read, your life will never be the same.",Positif
A gift: This was a gift for my son in law. We laughed till we cried on Christmas eve. Predictable and unexpected all at once the family spent the next day quoting lines from the various skits.A note the shipping was more than the cost of the DVD and seemed high for a small bubble wrap envelope. But it arrived in time as promised.,Positif
"Excellent look at our justice system: This movie totally opened my eyes and formed my opinion on capital punishment in our society. I feel if anyone believes in the death penalty they should see this movie before they commit themselves to it. Sarandon and Penn were both excellent, I was disappointed Penn didn't win an award, too.",Positif
Oliver Twist: Classic! It was a pleasure re-reading this book!I am again a Dickens fan. The history he describesas he tells this tale is amazing! I was too young atthe first reading to understand this. With this readingI am more aware of the historic descriptions Dickenspasses on to the reader.This will be relevant in the future.,Positif
A unique and interesting view of the future: Williamson creates a unique view of robots in the future. Humans create robots to help them with their work only to find things go awry. What makes this book great is the way it won't make you feel good by the end. That may seem paradoxical but it turns out to be refreshing and unique.,Positif
"Janet, is the Best female singer!: I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang ""I get Lonely"", ""Nasty"" and ""You"", it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!",Positif
"Awsome!: I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house. First, it allows you to keep the baby clean, because the bibsters are quite big. Second, they are waterproof and learning to drink out of a cup is always wet. And, third, no washing and a new, clean, spotless bib each time. Makes parenting a bit easier!",Positif
P=Perfectly different: This is not a typical Kinsey Milhone mystery and unless you are a hard-core Grafton fan you might not like this one. This one has alot of stuff on Medicare and Social Security regs and this can be dull but in Grafton's (Kinsey's) hands it isn't. Best moment when Kinsey realizes she bugging the wrong suspect.,Positif

"Best Ballad Singer of his times next to Tim Buckley and Tim Hardins: Bob Dylan: Eric Andersen is one of the best ballad singers I have listenedto. Now that is the truth and a true compliment.

"Hilarious: As the human companion of two cats gone bad, I recognized WAAYYYY too many behaviors and expressions in this book. I've given it as a gift to other cat owners who also loved it. Also worth getting: the bad cats calendar. In this house, we're very hard pressed not to peek ahead (and if no one's looking, sometimes I do!).",Positif
"Good Quality: These spoons are heavy duty and good quality. They stand up to being left inside a pot while it's on the stove. My only complaint is that the color is pink and not red. My husband definitely made a comment about this and said he won't be using these. Other than the color being misrepresented, these are good utensils.",Positif
"this is one of the best movies ever: this movie shows the triumph and tradegy of those 3 days in July when America's future depended on what side won.

"Awesome book. Thrilling, Suspenseful: This is a crazy story about one of America's most dangerous serial killers.

A great read.",Positif
"not bad viven leigh: i watched this verison of anna karenin right after i watched the greta garbo verison. i like that it extends the story in the movie, but i wished it showed anna having vronsky's baby(alive),levin and kitty's love story and the aftermath of anna's suicide. oh, well. onto the next movie verison of anna karenina.",Positif
"A great show: BUY IT!!!! Since i live in New Mexico, i rarely get the chance to see great shows so i resort to DVD's. That said, this is probably the next best thing to a Metallica concert. The set list was great. Kirk did mess up his ""One"" solo but i think that we can overlook that. Highly Recommended. Favorite songs: All tracks.",Positif
I would buy again: My daughter got this toy for Christmas right about the time she was starting to stand alone. I really do think it has helped her learn to walk. Although as soon as she could walk without it she lost interest in it. I do like that it has a wide base and is adjustable as far as speed. I think I would buy it again.,Positif
Tingle Toes: This foot massager is easy to use and leaves your feet feeling tingly . The aftereffect is a mild sensation up the legs that feels like the circulation is going. Much better than the cheaper foot massagers that have no effect at all.Good to share with friends and family . A conversation piece that tickles the fancy ..,Positif
Julia Navarro rocks: This is a very well written book. It has all the elements to keep you interested from the first to the last page. The final it's very well articulated. In the line of Da Vinci Code this book is maybe even better. Navarro is a great writer and I hope to read more from her. Congratulations!. Highly recomendable.,Positif
"Switching Goals - a very good movie: Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn't as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won't regret it.",Positif
The Death Committiee: A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.,Positif
Great Special Effects With Humor Throughout: I thought that this movie was great. I love Brendan Frasier's acting ability and I can always expect to laugh when I am watching a film he is in. I felt that the story line could have moved a little faster at the beginning with a little less violence but all and all a fun movie to watch.,Positif
"Its what I wanted!: I am very pleased, compatible with windows vista, (was worried) and as far as battery usage, I walk on my treadmill for 40 mins and I usually don't have a bar missing from the battery for atleast 3 uses, not to mention the battery has 3 bars. Very lightweight and user friendly. Will buy another for my boyfriend.",Positif

In my top 5 albums of all time.",Positif
BANGIN BEATS: This album was a great contribution to the current state of music. Aaliyah's music was never one to be in the normalcy but she really blew us away with this album. She showed us her womanly attitudes and she shared her sexiness with us in a real classy way. I like this album and will keep it in the stereo for a while.,Positif
"Totally Awesome: Ok, I'm a Baby Boomer and grew up watching science fiction, both good and bad. This movie is still my favorite.

""Forbidden Planet"" is truely a classic and will be enjoyed by any generation.",Positif
A fabulous book.: This is one of the first books that I really couldn't put down. It was easy to read and had me spellbound from the moment I started reading. It tugged at the heart strings and brought a tear to my eye in some parts. Eventhough it was set in 1952 in may ways it could still happen today. A story I won't soon forget.,Positif
"amazing!: i realli think this book is worth it. it teaches you how to draw man and female, how to draw the clothes when there sitting and sooo much more! i reccomend his book for anyone that wants a challenge on drawing.... it is sooo worth it considering that it takes up every topic. thats pretty much why i gave this book 5 stars!",Positif
"The title says it all: Whether you want to improve your awareness, manage a suspect diagnosis or learn how to live with breast cancer, this is the book.Short, objective, strictly to the point, it provided the guidelines my wife and I needed to seek and be reassured of a competent strategy to face this difficult but curable disease.",Positif
"Classic album: Terry Stamp and Jim Avery and company provide the perfect antidote to the complexities that became adult oriented rock. This was uncompromising honest stuff. Brilliant songs, well performed. It pre-dated pub rock, punk rock and the like and set the blueprint. If you only ever buy one rock album then make it this one.",Positif
Sippie cup saver.: Playtex spill-proof cups are worth their weight in gold to any parent with toddlers. The cup is only as good as the valve though. I had 2 cups that were pretty much useless without working valves. I was so happy to not have to throw these cups away. I ordered 2 packs as more valves are surely to go bad over time.,Positif
"If you plan to purchase only one Nelons release, this is it.: This has become my favorite southern gospel tape. The group has made full use of the members' vocal talents.

"A great second volume: As of always Norman Geisler pumps out another book , which is very clear and sharp on the doctrines of God and the origins of creation.This book and also with his first volume is a must for all theological thinkers.I cant wait until his next volume comes out.

Great DVD!: My 2 year old son loves this video. He is currently in speech therapy because he was not talking much. Just in the past month his language has exploded and this DVD has taught him all of the letters and what sound they make. The repetitive use of the song and the visuals make learning fun and easy for a child of any age!,Positif
"This wrench set is awesome!: A coworker of mine had the Gearwrench set for a few months and after tiring of walking down to his space to borrow them, I decided to get my own.These are great. If you are working in a tight area and the fastener is even slightly rusted, these are the ticket. Highly recommended especially at this price.",Positif
"Six Stars if I could.: One of the bset films ever made, if not the best. It twists and turns like a twisty-turny thng. Stagering performances all round, atmospheric music, brilliant script, mind scrambling plot, great locations etc etc ad nauseum.But I must agree with another of the reviewers, NO SEQUEL EVER! This film stands alone.",Positif
"An uncomplicated book for its time: The book does a good job of keeping the storyline simple and uncomplicated .. not too many characters. However, the fact that it is the first book Jane Austen wrote comes across easily.. it cannot compare with other books of hers. It has a particularly abrupt ending which was rather disappointing.",Positif
"outset qn70 grill wok: My wife and I belong to weight watchers. So we started grilling vegetables on the grill. This wok is perfect for grilling veggies along side of steaks, hotdogs, or hamburgers. It does a nice job and is easy to clean, just don't forget to pick it up with a pot holder. We have lost 30 pounds each after 3 months.",Positif
a delight and totally enjoyable: I smiled and laughed out loud so much with this one that my roomate couldn't wait for me to finish so she could get her hands on it. It's one of the better young adult books and totally believable. I had more fun with this book probably than anything else I've read. Couldn't wait to read the 2nd one!,Positif
"Zevon is the best: While this is not his best work, it's a great album none-the-less. ""Nobody's in Love This Year"" is probably the saddest, most depressing song ever written and I never get tired of hearing it. Other classics like ""Down in the Mall"" and Networking"" (both way ahead of their time) make this a must have for Zevon fans.",Positif
"Great!: I like em a lot, wife thinks they're the best cereal she's ever had, teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food, the others here like them enough.

"This was so funny: I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine.",Positif
"A perfect film: ""Babe"" comes the closest to being a perfect film out of anything I've seen. Everything in the film should be there, and nothing seems to be missing -- the funny touches with the mice, the love between Babe and Farmer Hogget, the themes on family and self-identity -- any adult or child can watch this movie and love it.",Positif
"WARREN AND MAY ARE GREAT!!!!!: I love this film, although I have to agree that the print suffers. I wouldn't be that concerned about it if it wasn't for Capra Jr. raving about it as much as he did. Overall his commentary is interesting although somewhat repetitive. ""Lady For a Day"" is a real classic and should have been on Criterion.",Positif
"My favourite move EVER!: This movie is good too the end! It shows the uncertainties of being a young girl, and the troubles of having growing up and having a father remarry, etc. Anna Chlumsky does an excellent job in this movie, and Macaulay Culkin plays a very convincing best friend. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry!",Positif
"awesome.: This is an awesome battery. The only negative is the install into my 2006 Hummer H3 was a bit tricky because it sits weird in the battery box. Its not level and doesn't look right, but after pulling it out and trying to install it many different ways thats the only way it fits in the battery box. Definitely worth the money.",Positif

Enjoyable read: I enjoy Catherine Anderson's books and this one didn't disappoint. The fear that the heroine had of her brother-in-law was a little over the top but then back then a female wasn't always listened to. The end of the trial was a little unbelievable and wrapped up a little to pat but overall the book was still enjoyable.,Positif
"DVD: In March I posted a message entitled DVD please. To my amazement, it is now June and I already have Flambards on DVD - from ... of course.

"Great! All the way until the end...: This was my first Tom Clancy novel and I have to say that I truly enjoyed it up to the end. I thought that the ending was somewhat predictable and boring. After reading 700+ pages I expected more of an intense ending and not some rush job. I think the ending must have contracted the ""shiva"" virus.",Positif
"Perfect music for when you are mad at the world!!: I had been borrowing this CD from a friend for about the longest time now, and I finally went out and bought it.

"Almost Perfect: A very well made sword. Excelent balance. However there is a minor flaw in the finish on both sides of the blade. Not enough to cause me to return it, but enough to make me wonder if this is a second. If I had paid the full price advertised on the cold steel site I would definately have sent it back for a replacement.",Positif
Just what I needed: This charger is just what I needed for my Garmin Street Pilot c550. I was tired of turning on my computer just to charge the GPS after a long drive. This just plugs into the power socket and charges the device very quickly. You can also use the device while it is charging. One month old and I'm very happy with it.,Positif
"High Quality For a Reasonable Price: I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions, there was no leakage or fogging. This case absolutely works as advertised.",Positif
"Good diaper: This is the best diaper I have found next to the old Pampers Cruisers. They are not as soft as I'd like and they don't have a liner like I'd want, but they don't leak even after a 12 hour night with my heavy wetter. They are more economical than the new Pampers Cruisers and I think probably a better diaper overall anyway.",Positif
You must have a copy of this book for your own!: I read Cheaper by the Dozen more than 20 years ago in Thai edition. And I bought it to all of my friend for presents.

"Best version of him: Mas Amedda was always one of the more interesting aliens in the prequels. This figure gets pretty high marks. The only thing I would like to see in a future update is a soft goods outer cloak. The hard plastic works well enough but limits articulation. Also, the soft goods would probably just look even more regal.",Positif
"Every bit as good as The Toxic Avenger: I have seen this film many times and never get tired of it. I would mention the plot,but who cares about the plot in a film like this? For some reason,this isn't as respected as The Toxic Avenger,and I wonder why. The laughs in this film are nonstop and any comedy fan should check this film out.",Positif
"Excellent edition of the complete works: If you want the complete works on a budget, this is the best choice. It's the full Arden text, with a good glossary at the end of the book. Each play begins with a brief introductory note. You don't get the extensive footnotes of the individual Arden plays, but for many readers, that's a bonus.",Positif

"great fan: This is a high quality fan. It gives off a powerful blast of air. The fan doesn't take up a lot of space, which is great. The sound that comes from the fan is medium volume, which is perfect. It's loud enough to block noises such as loud talking coming from the neighbors, but the fan is not loud enough to be annoying to you.",Positif
This is music to bring back memories: The calm and soothing interplay of saxaphone and voice is something rare today.

Great Sci Fi and excellent special effects.: Very original story about a planet with 3 Suns and a coming eclipse to become the mother of all eclipses.

"Exelent, real diference: the condoms look really small, but, once you put on are really confortable. Maybe if you're a horse (more than 8"" or 9"")it's not going to work for you but if you're in the range 6""-8"" it's ok. The feeling improove in about a 15% and you can feel it!. I totally recomended. 4 stars beacause any condom it's perfect.",Positif

I can use these methods to mislead people!",Positif
"Worth more than One Minute: A little oversimplified and repetitive, but still a classic management book. Every leader should read this. Its concepts are so simple, and yet, there are so many managers in the world who remain ignorant of them! I wish every boss and senior colleague I have ever had, have, and will have would read this book.",Positif
"And I don't have short arms.........: I had shoulder surgery and had to buy a recliner to sleep in as I healed.

My whole family is glad, since even my 6'2"" husband and father had trouble reaching it to.",Positif
"It's Pup-Kin, not Pump-kin: Hilarious! I loved it. Best movie Jerry Lewis has ever been in. The reason, he did not have to act. He was playing himself. Perfect role, for a perfectly self-bloated character. DeNiro is weird, funny, off-beat, scary (as usual) and wonderful in this flick. I highly recommend this relatively low-profile movie.",Positif
"Craig David- Take a listen.: Craig David has bought a new sound to R&B music. He along with others has made music come back to life again. With his mix of garage and two-step, he makes music worth while again. Not to mention his beautiful melodic voice that makes his music listenable each time. He definitely isnt hard on the eyes either.",Positif
"The only good Sonic cartoon.: I loved this show when I was a kid. I would wake upe very Saturday morning to watch it.

"Classic Survival Story: This is a very good book about surviving as a POW in Vietnam. Itdoes get a bit lengthy at time when he is discussing the attemptsto ""correct"" his attitude and he describes the same philosophya few times too many but it is an extremely in depth look atthe philosophical and mental problems faced by a POW in Vietnam.",Positif
"Came in stated condition.: I read the previous reviews and many complained of a strong, new ""chemical"" smell. Although it did have a strong smell when I opened it and used it the first time, by the next day the smell had disappeared. Not sure if it's worth the exra few dollars compared to the other similar yet cheaper yoga mat on Amazon.",Positif
This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!,Positif

"Ever the best of friends!,...: ...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did.

Good Bike Rack: Bought this bike rack and it works perfect. Amazon was running it on a deal so I like that I got it for even cheaper than it was originally posted. My only complaint is that if your bike isn't shaped just so the bike sits a bit funny on the rack. It still works but you have to secure it from a bar that fits into the plate.,Positif
"John M. Keane - Music!: Yes, John M. Keane -- Of the Keane Brothers!!! He and his wife produced this line of videos -- around the time they had their first child.

I intend to get all of Andrew Chaikin's books.,Positif
"Amazingly deep for its length: A slim book, only 86 pages. It's the story of a woman who has just lost her father and is dealing with that, and at the same time trying to get pregnant, something she's been struggling with for a long time. A very likable narrator. Fusselman does a great job of conveying emotional depth with very few words.",Positif

I strongly anticipating to see what else these guys do!",Positif
Unforgetable book.: I read this book in High School (late 80's) on a recomendation of a friend and I just loved it.

Dead Allive is a must to in my pesonal opinion.,Positif
"Good idea... best for heat!: The back pack is a great idea, but seems to work better for heat than for cold. A minute or two in the microwave makes it piping hot and the heat lasts for some time... Hours and hours in the freezer and only a few minutes of cold on the back. A little disappointing that way, but the heat factor is worthwhile.",Positif
"definitely the best horror\suspense book I know: Since you open the book you cannot close it,you have to go through, to dive in the horror, in the thrill, in the lush.

Job Boss Compressor Review: This compressor has delivered in all of the areas I expected. It is very portable and easy to use. CFM output is very adequate for small jobs or larger demands for short periods of time. My only disappointment was with the handle assembly. I feel that it should be more secure with some sort of locking mechanism.,Positif
On its own merit: Great MOVIE. Movies should never be compared to the books. The books are always better. Several books have such awesome characters and stories that you just need to see them on the screen. This is one of them. It's one person's interpretaion of the book. Still a damn good movie. I liked it better than Saving Private Ryan.,Positif
"Pure Genius: First published in 1949 this book will never go out of print while there is still a demand for startling, precise and lucid argument.

Read it and think!",Positif

I love this set.",Positif
"Matheson's Legend: Matheson is a master craftsmen of the sci-fi and horror genre. This novel is no exception and is my favorite thus far.

But definitely check it out - it's a great read.",Positif
Far better than expected.: I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected.

"The Craziest Most Beautiful Movie In A Long Time: A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time.

"Good mirror: This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface, which is great. It doesn't minimise or enlarge the reflection, so is a true reflection.

Through his relationship with her, he begins to see past the darkened skin and slanted eyes of the Japanese into their hearts. The ending was very sad. I reccomend this book to everyone.",Positif
"New to philosophy: I read this book last semester in my Philosophy 100 class.

The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!: These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size.

"A wonderful book, but scents aren't strong: Like others have stated, I was so thrilled to see this book from my childhood, but disappointed that the scents are weak to non-existent. It's a very cute book, though, and my preschooler loves it as much as I did. Perhaps we're all remembering it idealistically and the original was the same quality.",Positif
"Kudos to Laurence Yep: Wow! To be honest, when my mom gave this book to me for my birthday, I was less than enthused, once I read it, however, I couldn't put it down!! It demonstrates how girls, even 1,000 years ago had ""girl power"". Also, the message that I think Laurence Yep is trying to get across is quite clear, war doesn't solve anything.",Positif
"Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can't recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan.",Positif
"A Sherlock Holmes Story Starring...Dr. WATSON!: Well, you don't get much of Holmes in this story, and many folks either neglect to mention that or just don't notice. I figure they don't notice because it's such a darn good read. At first, it's TALK, TALK, TALK. But the restlessness left me with oncoming chapters and I became engrossed. Read it!",Positif
"Good Anime: If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it, so its rare I ever complaint about it.

"Excellent Album: This is an excellent album, not only because Dee Dee is a fantastic singer, but also because she was able to provide some of the first vocal versions of many of the tunes. Nica's Dream is amazing with vocal precision most singers fall short of delivering. Lonely Woman is haunting and melodic. Overall, this is a fantastic album.",Positif
"Very confotable and configurable gamepad.: It's confortable, specially if you have big hands. I use it to play Fifa 2003 and X-Wing alliance. The software that maps the keys of the gamepad to those required by the game allows you to use it for any game.Actually I prefer it over a joystick for flight simulator games. It's a lot more confortable.",Positif
"Their best CD no doubt: I didn't care to much for their music after ""Core"" and ""Purple""... or so I thought. I just knew what I heard on the radio. I bought ""Thank you"" just to see and then I bought this one. ""Shangri-La Dee Da"" was so good that I had to go back and get ""Tiny Music From The Vatican Gift Shop,"" which is also excellent by the way.",Positif
Stunned at how good the sound on this SACD: I have many SACDs and DVD Audio discs but none hit me as hard as this one did.

Please get full range speakers for all 5 speakers to truly benefit from these SACD's.,Positif
"Great product!: Great product, the best trackballs out there. I had a customer support issue that was resolved after I escalated it a bit.

They need to improve the drivers for Windows 7, but I understand it is in process.",Positif
"Bridges outstanding, Goodmen a gem......: If you like laid-back humor, this is one of those hidden gems. It's a film that uses the F-Word every 30 seconds or so, so it's not for everybody. If you like Jeff Bridges, it's worth viewing the dynamics of Bridges in action. Goodmen, also keeps this film alive and kicking as well as funny........Enjoy",Positif
"The book is sensitive and touching.It is unpretentious.: Illa's character is difficult to understand.for a girl with so much exposure how come she was singularly lacking in ambition.Herlove for nick and her subsequent marriage tohim is so tragic because it is one-sided.Ironically all the Indian characters suffer from unrequited love,wonder why?",Positif

"You'll Believe a Man Can Fly: The first (and best) of the big-budget Christopher Reeve adventures, with the expanded 151-minute version a slight improvement over the 1978 theatrical cut.

"I agree: I agree with the review from August 8, 2000 in that Mary Anne needs to move on and it wouldbe cool to have her do something else. However, I did really enjoy the book.

But when he did, it was great.",Positif
"best cthulhu adventure ever: I think that the title to this review says it all. The Masks of Nyarlathotep is by far the best cthulhu adventure that i have played (much better than Delta Green), due to the feeling of, well, 'authenticity' and adventure. But most of all lots of fun. Easily a choise for one of my top 5 modules of any gaming system.",Positif
Wild Ravens: Altonya Washington has done it again. My favorite stories from her are the ones that take place in the late 1800's. She is a very gifted writer. I found myself so fasinated by the characters in the book that I found it difficult to put it down. The romance between the main characters was wonderful. All I can say is that I want more.,Positif
"Beautifully documented and narrated video.: When I saw this documentary on TV in South Africa, I knew I had to have a copy of it. It took me ages to find a copy but it was well worth the wait.

"An upfront challenge for the brainy: I have chosen to read this book as it is listed by a world distinguished magazine among the best spy novels ever writtenThe plot is a challenge to the reader intelligence since one cannot predict the outcome until the last word on the last page, and that is the essence of a spy novel.

Patterson has outdone himself yet again.",Positif

You'll never laugh harder.",Positif
"Groovy, funky, out of control good!!!!: I purchased this album after hearing ""slide"" on download.com. That song is so slick that I assumed the rest of the cd must be good. I was right!!!

It is the first book about Hepatitis C I have ever read that made me feel better about Hep C when I read it, rather than sick to my stomach.",Positif
"Classic: I had this album on cassette tape when I was a child, and loved The Muppets and every one of their movies.

St. Louis Buyer: I purchased this toy because I thought that it could teach a child just turning 3 about colors and shapes. My son says our Grandson loves it and plays with it all the time.

Mac sounds like a really promising romantic interest; I hope he appears in the next book.",Positif

I just recently discovered this film, and I'm glad I did.",Positif

Summer of my german solider review: I enjoyed this book a great deal. The story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing.

I enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.,Positif
"Mest is WICKED: Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)",Positif
"The holy one is dethroned: God Dethroned's vocals can sometimes lack in quality, but their amzing riffs make up for any lost. This double-disc offers many quality black/death metal songs. Warkult is the song that i get hooked on the most. I suggest listening to them on the metal blade site before you buy it, just incase it isn't what you expected.",Positif
Clifford's First Valentine's Day Was Great!: Cliffords first Valentine's Day is a good book. It is best for kids the age of 4-6 because it uses small words. It is also easy for the children to comprehend. Clifford jumps into the mail cart and gets lost in the mail. I would recommend this book to any children interested in books. It is a good book.,Positif
"Perfect Tool!: This product is really nice. I love how light weight it is, yet so incredibly durable. Leatherman is a great company and I have to say, to this day, I have not had a bad product.

It was well recieved by both the Jewish and non-Jewish students.",Positif
Ominous story of a future world: Atwood has masterfully written a tale of future world in which women are enslaved by zealots of a new world order.

It stands as a classic.,Positif
"The Best in Mecha: This is much better than the other gundam series. Overall all of the gundam shows are the best mecha-type anime there is out there and has the best characters and the best action. I don't even like mecha that much, but out of all anime, gundam has become one of my favorites due to the great character detail and superb animation.",Positif

"a must for Celtophiles: This book is a collection of some of the best-preserved, non-Irish Celtic stories, which makes it a valuable resource for anyone studying Celtic literature and culture.

Child's writing kept me on my toes ...: Once again Lee Child has produced an extraordinary Jack Reacher tome. I had no idea what to expect.

Going where you don't expect to go.,Positif
"Not Iron Maiden...Not Gold Maiden...But Platinum Maiden!: This debut album marked the spawning of a band that wouldbecome one of heavy metal's greatest bands, right up there with Judas Priest!

"Superb and definitely worth more than a one-time read!: This book gives a great insight into the REAL Belgarath, the person who has as wonderful a sense of humour as Silk, only less evident in the Belgariad. I'm glad that the Eddingses have cleared up the mystery behind Belgarath's antecedents. It should be on every bookshelf-- truly a merry read!",Positif
Two good parts that give it 4 stars: I haven't seen the whole movie but just the parts I want to see. Such as... Ewen Mcgregor making out with Johnathan Rhys-Myers How hot is that!!!!

"The Real American Idol: This is the real American Idol! Clay's fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks.

Finally, a singer with TALENT!",Positif
Good Alertative HIstory.......: An oft time time spooky alternative history of a world where the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in war.The story of a newpaper reporter while in the process of reporting on just another murder stumbles across clues to the biggest secret known.

"Blu ray please!: I really enjoy this movie, I haven't read the book, but the storyline in the movie is excellent. I would buy this on blu-ray in a heartbeat if it were to become available. My only fault with the movie is that (in my opinion) the ""overdubbed voice-overs"" (not sure exactly what you call them) toward the end seem a little overbearing.",Positif
"Catcher in the Rye, 20 years on...: This book is for anyone who has reached that point in their life where they question whether there is any logic to the seemingly random series of memories they have aquired thus far.

Big ups to all those who are still avid fans!",Positif
"Great for small jobs: I use this for small jobs that I don't want to get a hand mixer our for. I love the fact that it is metal and not nylon, but I wish the very end had a bit of a pointed tip. It would make it much more useful when making gravy on a saucepan on the stove. Other than that, it is great and makes awesome pancakes and scrambled eggs.",Positif
"Sad, uplifting, and everything in between.: Morrissey's 1991 re-recording of his 1984 first album, Bill Morrissey captures the vulnerability and the hillarity of the artist.

"Light Duty Clipper: I needed something to get the branches that were out of reach and this does the job. My arm strength is limited and this is light.

This was a hard to find item, so guess it was worth the price.",Positif

"Cary Grant at his best: For those that have never seen a Cary Grant movie, this is a good place to start. The dialogue is rapid fire, the acting is superb.

If you are collecting Grant movies, this needs to be in your collection.",Positif
"Overall, a good read.: I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I was glad to see Scarpetta back. Even though this novel was weaker than her earlier ones, it was a far cry better than Southern Cross or Hornet's nest. Scarpetta's character was a little too depressed and drug the story down a little. Overall, though, it was enjoyable reading.",Positif

"good non serious read: This book was a fun quick read.

"Good buy with reservations: Of course the list price is a joke. However, for the price, the quality is quite good. It uses thin material but is fine for summer. It is about 1/2 size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes. Just remember, this is not your $65 deparment store shirt. And yes, only the blue colors look good.",Positif
"Justifiable Revenge: I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up, what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved.Rape and nude scenes so please beware, this 8o's film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of Charles Bronson's 10 to midnight.

But oh well, grease on dvd in both formats is good. get the ws though.",Positif
"Incredible!: This is a really thought provoking book, and ventures into a realm that nearly everybody, secretly wants. It is very high-detailed, yet the plot reads extremely quickly. There is no fluff. The ending really made me think, and after I read it, I felt a renewed sense of appreciation for the world we live in. Read this. You won't regret it.",Positif
"Great album: Last Rainbow album in the classic line-up and therefore a must have for Rainbow fans. I think Rainbow Rising is still there best recording, but this one has some great songs as well. I have the original LP and the production of the record is a bit ""light"". The remastered CD sounds a lot better, the only thing missing is some bonustracks.",Positif
"Lessons for Life: I have read this book twice and given it as gifts to several friends who work to make Gospel teachings a model for their everyday lives. There is something here for everyone--joy, sadness, hope. I especially recommend it to those in any profession related to Christian education or the ministry...it should be in every church library.",Positif
"AWESOME BLU RAY!!: I recieved Phenomena blu ray and I got to tell ya, the picture and sound are terrific and cool special features!! And it's region free (ABC)!!

"Not his best, still good though: Okay, this is not the best novel Patterson ever wrote, but it's still pretty good. It has his trademarks written all over it with the same characters, violence, and plots, but then, that's why we read him, right? Would also recommend Roses are Red, 2nd Chance, McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood, and Brown's Angels & Demons.",Positif
"A nice collection: This is a collection of speaches from some of our lesser founding fathers. It includes speaches by John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Noah Webster, George Bancroft, and Elias Boudinot. Each is preceded by some background information about the inidividual and other historical tidbits. Provides some excellent insight into the period.",Positif
"Definitive book. But what about the sequel?: This is the best book, for many reasons, on the night the Titanic sank. It is expertly constructed and wonderfully researched - he had access to survivors in the 1950s. So many people agree it is superb - but there is a sequel - ""The Night Lives On"" - I would like to buy that, but where is it? Anyone know?",Positif
"I Remember Sandy: I remember many of the cuts on this album when they were newly released. It's amazing, to me,that with all the innovation and broadening of our listening universe since the 1960s, how good this album still sounds. I have listened to the album the whole way through several times, and it still holds up and is a great joy to listen to.",Positif
"A True Crime Story: This book has all the components of a great book: Suspense, drama, twists and turns and a little comedy. From the start this story has you captivated. Truman Capote toys with the readers mind throughout the novel by making the reader feel sorry for the disturbed criminals. A great crime novel that is excellent from start to finish",Positif
Flash from the past!: I remembered this movie from high-school. I wanted it mainly to get ideas for a 70's theme party and I remembered the star role was very classy/chic. The clothing was on-target for what I was looking for. Quite humorous as I've matured alot since then. But is still good to reflect on what was then vs. what is now.Very nostalgic!,Positif
"Rad! Or as they say in Dutch, heel goed!: I love Holland and the Dutch language, and my Dutch penpal sent me a tape with various Dutch artists. I love ""Dromen Zijn Bedrog"", which is a mix of sort of modern-90s music, techno, and a chorus in the background. Fast and energetic! I don't recall the other songs too well but this album is awesome. Go Dutch!",Positif
"skillful: Reading this is reading a master at work. Pinsky wields so much skill it's ridiculous. Reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent, old man sitting in a chair somewhere in a field, giving his thoughts free rein, following them where they land. In my opinion, the poem ""The Figured Wheel"" is a lyrical, breath-taking masterpiece.",Positif
Works Great: Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.,Positif
"Don't insult Jordan's writing ability with a movie idea: I've read the Fallon series and the WOT series and couldn't even imagine them being deplored by a movie. Never in my life have I seen a movie that compared to the book. You wanna see a movie, fine, but writing as complicated and intertwined as Jordan's couldn't be put into a movie of any length.",Positif
"frozen and quirky: Doesn't everyone need a Marge in their lives? No crap, no nonsense and grounded--that's Marge, the pregnant cop, doing her job and awaiting her baby in the frozen tundra of the northern U.S. This Coen brothers film is so hilarious (and dark) that it really has to be savored frame by frame with no disturbance. It is utter perfection.",Positif
Visual delight with ethical dilemmas: I enjoy Robin William's in off beat non comedic roles and this is certainly one of them. The artistry and visual tools used are very intriguing yet the reason I purchased this was for the heaven/hell/suicide/power of love conflict. Film brought out many interesting dilemmas. And Cuba's performance is always solid.,Positif
fantastic!!!: I love this mixer!! I started with the kitchenaid 4 1/2quart mixer which was great but I was making a wedding cake and needed a bigger mixer. I mixes an amazing amount of batter. It does have a more metalic sound than my other mixer. I got the meringue color and it is beautiful. It has a pearly finish. The picture does not do it justice.,Positif
"More than Excellent!: I have read (audio) this book twice. It's in the line up once more. Mr. Ellis is one of the most outstanding authors of our time. His book on our Greatest President makes His Excellency a man above all others in the American experience. Without Ellis, most of us would be in the dark. Without Washington, there would be no America.",Positif
"The greatest Tosca ever recorded!: Period. I do not care what a Sills-Fanatic says. I love Nilsson's live Tosca with Carreras, also the live one with Corelli and if my memory serves me correctly McNeill as Scarpia. Hell, those were great performances. As was Tebaldi's with Corelli at the MET. And this one too. IMHO the best recording Callas ever made.",Positif

"love it: I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....This book (and the books after it) were great.

How happy they were when their father came home....Wonderful book. 5 stars.",Positif
"Middle Eastern fever: Highly energetic and downright rowdy quartet.It's hard to tell where improv ends & Khalife begins; brilliant~This group obviously plays together seamlessly -- like the Beatles over time.I'm sending JADAL to my percussionist grandson, along with Alhaj's ""When the Soul is Settled"" CD. Oud masters both, yet so delightfully different.",Positif
"Great rack for bigger bikes: After ordering two racks that would not mount properly, I ended up getting this one. My 25"" Trek is a huge bike and no other racks would mount at the right angle. This one however, fits like a glove.High quality build, very sturdy and solid. Lots of adjust ability so it'll fit everything from my wifes 17.5"" frame to my 25"".",Positif
"TFOH-- two thumbs up: I really enjoyed this book-- book six hasn't gotten here yet and the wait is almost unbearable. I didn't give it five starts because Elayne began to really tick me off around page... two hundred? Some of it was predictable but overall I thought it was well done, and it's keeping me waiting for ""Lord of Chaos"". Well worth the read.",Positif
"Great Selection: I have to say that I like Rhino and Varese Sarabande's CDs so much more that the slapped-together compilations that I find in the ""cheap racks"" at Tower (and other stores). This CD has a ton of great '80s hits on it...and the liner notes are really fact-filled, too. Get this and the Rhino New Wave CDs...you'll be set for your '80s fix!",Positif
"One of the greatest films of all time.: Charlton Heston gives his best performance of his long distinguished career as the Jew Judah Ben-Hur who stood up to the might of the Roman army and became a legend . Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are excellent as the boy hood friends turned foes.Oh yeah, watch out for the little chariot race, it's quite good.",Positif
"Best Green Powder You Can Buy: Green Vibrance is the most comprehensive powder you can find. It's got everything in it!

I recommend it to anyone that cares about maintaining a healthy body. Yay! Go Green!!",Positif
"Great CD: Years ago I heard the La's heartbreaking ""There She Goes"" on a Top 40 station. But for some reason it never received heavy rotation (this was 1990 or 1991 when Vanilla Ice and Marky Mark permeated the airwaves). Years later I bought the La's one and only CD expecting that to be the only decent song but I found the other songs were great, too.",Positif
"GREAT GREAT GREAT: I love this stuff!! Unlike most products that are supposed to take away the rest of your make-up, this really does! Not only does it do what it's supposed to but it's actually soothing. It doesn't not smell horribly like alcohol, and it doesn't make your eyes water and nose burn from the smell. I really love this, and enjoy using it.",Positif
"I remember Harry: I have to agree with other reviews that this is not one of Michael Connelly's tighter story lines. It felt very disjointed to me at several places. However, Harry, is as always, Harry... and has an incredible way of making the reader feel his moods and emotions. A good read though, and definitely recommended for Michael Connelly fans.",Positif
"the best book currently in the market: this book has been with me for the last 8 yrs.i like this book as all the info is imparted with the minimum usage of words,almost complete in itself,has references to original literature & with stunning clarity.if u are short of money go for it.it is the most complete ,self sufficient book available in the market.",Positif
"this is a good book!: I never wanted to read this until I borrowed it from a friend. Now, I am glad I did! If I had not read this book when I did, i never would have realized the connections with this series and others by Morris. The story is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you like these, you will love the Cheney Duvall series.",Positif
"Brilliant!: This is one of my favourite movies. Like other reviewers, I have been keenly awaiting this DVD release. This powerful gangster movie is brilliantly filmed and acted with Gabriel Byrne and John Turturro putting in the performances of their respective careers. The movie builds suspense and contains snappy dialogue and great one-liners. Enjoy!",Positif
wonderfully done: I especially enjoyed this book because he gave you an honest account of his rise to fame. His was not an easy journey and took a toll on his spirit and creativity. To see one of his performances you'd never guess the obstacles he had to overcome. It was inspiring and uplifting. Yanni fans will enjoy this look at the man and his music.,Positif
"DVD's would be nice: Since I could not afford the DVD set, I bought the book. I am working my way through it slowly. This is good stuff. I am at a point in my life where I have a lot of things to let go of. I have looked at several techniques and the reviews on this are impressive. So far, I like it. But I suspect the DVD's would be a whole lot easier!",Positif
"True sons of Merengue.: They have that unmistakable beet like their fathers. Which is always good to hear. But they have managed to do create a new style, whch is what makes this one ""mortal"".

"Seeing the Truth in the Logic: For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking, CS Lewis illustrates logically the need to not only acknowledge but address the existence of God but make a choice in where we stand and what we consider Truth. Use this as a starting point in a lifelong journey to gain an accurate picture of who God is.",Positif
I believe he is right: Stanley Tam believed in principles and in his faith. His story is truly amazing and his success cannot be disputed. Regardless of your faith or lack thereof the author does a great job in humbly recapping his lifetime achievements for our benefit. Give him a chance to tell you his story. I believe only good things will come of it.,Positif
Great transmitter but not universal: I ordered this expecting it to come with a 3.5mm connection but came with a different connection. Although it says designed for zune the pictures are misleading so if your looking for a universal transmitter make sure it is in fact universal. This transmitter is great rarely get static and its stereo so thats a plus!,Positif
"Wonderful Book: I bought this book because I had read 'So You Want to Be a Wizard' (the first book in the series to which this book is the sixth) when I was in elementary school, and for nostalgia's sake, I wanted to read the whole series. The book came in perfect condition (save a few dings in the softcover from shipping). It was well worth the money!!",Positif
"Classic!: I first heard about Larry from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The thing I like best about Larry is he shows you can be funny without cursing and making sex jokes left-and-right. I think most commedians curse just to get people in the audience.Larry is funny, and you don't have to be raised in the South to appreciate him, though it couldn't hurt.",Positif
"Funnier than expected: I was pleasantly surprised while watching this movie. The inclusion of The Rock helped decrease the overall dorkie-ness. Lots of fun and right up there with the Austin Powers movies.The Blu-Ray copy looked AMAZING. I did not see a copy of the regular DVD version so I have no real comparison but that aside, it looked crystal clear.",Positif
"Great non toxic product to reduce fly populations: Rescue FTA Fly Trap Attractant works great. Using new attractant in the reusable bottle is much more economical than the disposable traps. While there is a little odor close to the bottle, it can be used safely around pets where you wouldn't want to use poisonous sprays and powders. And it really works!",Positif
"The Best Sci-fi Movie Ever: Blade Runner (director's cut) has to be my favorite movie; it's special effects and setting are still visually stunning after 20 years, plus the breathtaking soundtrack and story make it a feast for the senses. Very few films can stand the test of time this well, and I cannot gush about this movie enough. It is a work of art.",Positif
Memorable drama for any baby boomer....: Thoroughly entertaining drama involving Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood in starring roles about unrequited love in times of tough family values and expectations.I have enjoyed this movie for decades on TV and VHS and now complete the circle with my own CD format.Handy hint: keep a box of Kleenex within easy reach!,Positif
"Very artistic: This movie is very graphic and dark - themed, but it isn't one of those stupid action movies like Die Hard or Resident Evil (the games are much better than the movies). It's very artistic, with a lot of plot and story. There are 4 stories in this movie, and a few of them intersect. Anyone who is faint of heart should not watch this movie.",Positif
"Please, mum, can I have some more?: This is a fabulous recording, finally available on CD! Lorraine Duisit plays a variety of stringed instruments and plays them really well. Tom Espinola is a fine player as well. I loved Lorraine in the band Trapezoid. Here she plays w wide breadth of music im the same vein. My only wish is that she sing a little more.",Positif
"No Response: This is supposed to be a review of the product but it is a review of Amazon. I ordered a used copy of this CD. I was charged for a new copy. I e-mailed Amazon to find out what happened before even receiving my CD to tell them what's up and received no reply. I'm keeping the CD, paying new price and will probably start CD shopping elsewhere!",Positif
"I never forgot this!: This miniseries has stayed in my mind since I saw it about 20 years or so ago. I love every second of it. The scenery is gorgeous,the storyline engrossing, the music haunting ( I haven't seen it in a few years but can still hum the music!), and the acting superb(I still have a thing for Steve Grives, Mark). God, I love this series!",Positif
"Wonderful Spiritual Guide: I very much enjoyed reading A Gift from the Sea. I agree that we need time alone, to ponder the small miracles of life. We need to keep our lives simple and unburdened. While that is a goal that no one could or should always have it is important to regenerate ourselves with simplicity. The beach is a great space to do that in.",Positif
"Loud, But That's How I Like It: I bought these specifically because they are loud. They provide good white noise for the whole family to sleep by. Don't have to worry about waking the kids when we're getting ready in the morning, etc. If the kids are hot at night, they point the air flow directly at them, and it blows good enough to help keep them cool.",Positif
"Funky 70s gem: The kid was just 21 when he made this in 1972, playing everything, except a solo here or there. Full of retro 70s Motown funk. Awesome, still, to this day. The creativity and invention never flags here. This one kicked off the classic period when he released a series of albums, each one topping the next for genius and creativity. Amazing.",Positif
"A remarkable, moving tale: This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read in my 42, book-filled years. Although it was a little hard to read the last few pages through the strange veil of water that seemed to fill my eyes, I simply cannot recommend this story highly enough. We could all learn a lot from Mrs. Chippy, an Explorer like no other.",Positif
Miracle On 34th Street: Usually a remake of an original does not pass the test of being better. This one certainly does surpass the original although both versions are great. If you like Natalie Wood then the original version is for you. This one with Richard Attenborough will certainly warm your heart. The entire cast was perfect for this movie. Enjoy!,Positif
absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie: Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave's protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it's simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.,Positif
"The most versitile shirt you will ever own.: This shirt is great by itself, under an cotton shirt, under sholder pads, and even under a coldgear shirt.

This a must have for your under armour wardrobe.",Positif
"THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ENDING. . . OR IS IT?!: This book is ultra-rare, so if you can get a copy, keep it. I stole mine from the public library. The book visits some of the old Spacer worlds from the Robot novels, and it is interesting to see how time has treated them. This book also provides incite into the WHOLE Foundation series! THIS IS A MUST!!!!!",Positif
"Hilarious!: I absolutely love the Fresh Prince, and buying this season was a great investment! I personally think Season 4 is the best, but this one is a close second. Also, Season 3 has bloopers at the end of every episode that I love, but I don't believe any of the others do...which is a little disappointing. Regardless, I will be buying Season 6 soon!",Positif
"Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive, considering how much ink it is. I think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all. I've been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for 2 months and the first bottle isn't even noticiably lower on ink. Shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape. Overall a great experience.",Positif
It's finally on DVD!: I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since I first got a DVD player about three years ago. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as a man falsely accused of murder trying to find his wife's killer. The plot is very interesting and original and presented so that it is believable and intense. Definitely a must-have.,Positif
"Truely awsome: Ralph Towner has got to be one of the finest guitarists thathas ever lived. This live album is spectacular. I have hadthe great fortune of seeing Ralph perform live on severaloccasions in the 1970's: solo, with Oregon, and with thePaul Winter Consort. His performances were nothing butawe inspiring! This album is a masterpiece and its LIVE!",Positif
"Good Book but no music on Kindle Touch: The book is fantantic, with lots of information and figures.The only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book, this can only be done in Fire version or Kindle for Iphone or Ipad, not even on Kindle for PC. I really can't understand!",Positif
"Good but wordy: It is a good book for you to pass SCBCD. All content focuses on exam objectives. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because it is too wordy. Some people might love the book since it makes them smile. But if your goal is only to pass SCBCD, the wordy content is useless and wastes your time.Anyway, I passed SCBCD with 91% by using this book.",Positif
"A wake-up call to just about everyone: ""As A Man Thinketh"" should be on everyone's Short List of Must Reads.Inspiring, it clues the clueless into their personal responsibility in their life.

There are also two more books that follow.",Positif
Great gift for your Nascar lover: I searched all over my local stores for something like this. The challenge was many local memorabilia stores have closed down due to the economy. I was so excited to find it online. It was delivered very timely. The packaging was impeccable. The color and detail is brilliant. We cannot wait to hang it in our Nascar room.,Positif
"A stylish and distinctive glass: These lightweight, stemless glasses turn heads. When I use them for entertaining, everyone seems to want a set. They're dishwasher safe (top rack) and appear to be pretty well made. These make a great gift -- the packaging is pretty nice. I recommend ordering two boxes (four glasses). At these prices, that's still a deal.",Positif
GOOD NIGHT MR. TOM: GNMT was a great novel and a great insight in war times. Willie has never experienced life other than the abuse from his motherWhen he stays with Mr. Tom he learns compasion and love and in the end calls him dad as Mr. Tom adopts him. He had never celbrated a birthday or even seen a cow this book is great for all readers at any level.,Positif
"Babe, Pig in the City: It was fascinating how previous reviewers differed from one another. In fact, this film is a masterpiece, but perhaps too sophisticated for children--and many adults! It's really kind of a ""Pig Noir"". The musical score was magnificient ranging from classical through pop to jazz--each selection intensifying the action on the screen.",Positif
Not Free SF Reader: The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the story of a British Secret Service agent who leaves that organisation and basically defects to East Germany.What he does not realise for a while is that he is actually being manipulated by his former masters as they play a complicated game of espionage with other assets in place in his new home.,Positif
"The Holocaust For Real: I have watchd many movies that ""hollywoodize"" the holocaust and use theatrics to depict what happened. ""Night"" is the most gripping tale of that horrific event I have read or seen. Kudos to Elie Wiesel for being able to control his emotions to write such a compelling, real-life, emotional story. He richly deserves the Nobel Prize.",Positif
"Great movie. Very disturbing.: First of, the quality of the DVD was good. No skips or anything wrong with the audio. As far as the movie itself. You have to wonder how many kinds of drugs was in their system when the movie was written. Unfortunately, the plot does resemble what society was like at that time. It's not a family time movie, that's for sure.",Positif

"Good Light - Better for ""being seen"": I think this is a great set - the lights are small and easy to install (the rear light easily fits on my Topeak rack), but these lights are better for being seen than seeing.

"Another great adition to the Wheel of time series...: Some people will say this book is slow. Well it is only true for the slow minded.

It is very good that he did it because sometimes you look back on a story and it just doesn't make any sense. -A very smart adition to the series.",Positif
"Amazon needs to sell the original version: The directors cut is very disappointing.

However, a quick trip to the hardware store and I'll have what I need. Since I really like the shelf, it's worth it.""",Positif
"The best book second only to the Bible!!!!!: This romance captures you right from the beginning. Miss Austen, though never married, understood true romance. She describes both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy so vividly the reader cannot fail to have a pure picture in mind. I would fail to see how anyone could read this novel and not want to start a new romance.",Positif
"Nothing but Excellent: I loved Mistress because it portrays the ""behind the scenes"" of what producing a movie is truly about. I loved Sheryl Lee Ralph in this movie because it portrays what just be me going on in our movie industry. Sheryl is an excellent actress and need to be seen in more excellent movies. Excellent producing/directing on DeNiro's part.",Positif
"Great bed for guests: I highly recommend this item, and it's a great price with Amazon Prime.My son uses this whenever he sleeps over. He loves it, says that it's like sleeping on a cloud. With the electric pump, which is attached, it inflates and deflates super fast. It also folds up into a rather small rectangle, and it comes with a canvas bag for store.",Positif
"the bad quality doesn't ruin the concert: yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert, bad quality or not. I'm only 16 and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity. I believe the Ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting, adrogyny is the only way to go!",Positif
Amazon shipping: This rice cooker works great. My only complaint is with Amazon. This is the 2nd non-book item I've ordered from Amazon and I don't understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing. Thankfully this item arrived in good shape. This is something to think about when ordering non-book items from Amazon.,Positif
This a real movie about real things.: This movie paints a picture of what goes on in the lives of kids all across the nation daily. This is a must see movie for many parents. Your kids may be faced with many of these decisions every day. It portrays some of the pressure for teens in a modern society. You need to see this movie and thoroughly understand it.,Positif
"great: These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green, depending on the lighting, people can see your eyes, this happens about % of the time. outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great.",Positif
"Magnet mount antennas: Simple. Effective. Easy. Portable. Switchable between vehicles. Inexpensive for what you get. It doesn't get any better does it?? :-) I could make this long and add a bunch of tech notes ie ease of adjusting SWR; effective range etc etc, but I think it is unnecessary.

"Required reading: If society is to ever evolve and embrace an ethic of compassion toward humans and animals, it will only happen when we confront the ideas presented in this book. Reading Eternal Treblinka is not always a pleasant experience, but it is, nonetheless, a vital one. This book should be required reading in every secondary school in the country.",Positif
"this was the kind of sound that drew me to Morcheeba...in the first place: All these poor reviews, this singer is the exact sound that just kept bringing me back to Morcheeba, after previewing other albums, this is the one that makes me listen to Morcheeba, especially the song Wonders Never Cease. Skip the reviews and listen to the music all you newcomers.",Positif
"Worth your $6.62: Certainly, a lot of the stuff on here is expendable, but for the 9 or 10 songs that are great, it's an amazing deal for $6.62.If you liked the Holly Golightly appearance on ""RFTC,"" you'll be happy with her guest vocals on four songs on this disc.Great cover of a Real Kids song. Why isn't ""Tarzan"" a million-seller? It's RFTC at their best.",Positif
Aztec: One of the things I like about Mr. Jennings work is that he manages to describe the cultures he writes about in the contex of that culture. It's rare to be thrown so completely into a world that no longer exists and discover only when you've put the book down that you had left your own world and all its judgmental comparisons behind for a few hours.,Positif
"Incredible Amount of Detail and an Engaging Story: Gary Jennings' massive novel Aztec is packed with so much detail that it could double for nonfiction--and should find its way into many classrooms across the country. But background info isn't everything, and the historical fiction offers up an engrossing story to serve as a vehicle to its lectures. Bravo.",Positif
"Great for the summer: My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again.",Positif

Incredible: One of the best games ever to play against your friends. A top five game as far as the n64 was concerned. Its a game hat changes the football rules slightly while still holding the integrity of what the sport is. Just incredible as far as the fun factor goes. Definately a game that makes pulling the n64 out of the closet. Five stars all the way!,Positif
"Listen to it again: When I first heard this album, I was thinking...um, no. But I listened to it a few times more (being a fan) and discovered its greatness. Now, not every track is great, but those that are make up for the others. I found it has a really great retro-80's sound that I hear others trying to produce, but didn't hit the mark like this one did.",Positif
"Great reference: I have a 30 year old version of this book that my mother used in college. If you want to know how to integrate any weird function, look in here. The best table of integrals i've ever seen, and lots of helpful formulas and references. A terrific reference. I have used this book for virtually all my classes as an Electrical Engineering major.",Positif
Very good book: I read this book to preview it before gifting it to my 12 year old nephew. I wanted to make sure it is appropriate for his age. I did not expect to get sucked into the story as much as I did. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. My only complaint is that the ending was rather abrupt and didn't really leave me with any sense of resolution.,Positif
"Hanson Similarity: I think gameface is a _really_ good band, and I don't know if i noticed it before hearing the new Hanson, but the vocals on this album on the Gameface tracks sounds mysteriously like Taylor from everyone's favorite teen-pop-stars Hanson. But despite that frightening coincidence, it's my one of my favorite albums, and well worth the money.",Positif
"If I Could I Would Give It 10 Stars.: I love all the NBA Streets series. Missing Michael Jordan but who cares this game is still fun as hell. The graphics are beautiful.

Are a guitar musician.",Positif
"Season 6 -- A New Era: I think the show really peaked during seasons 3, 4, and 5, with the best season in my opinion being #4. Just incredible material. Season six is on the back end of the shows' peak; however, it is nonetheless fantastic!! Some great moments for sure. Don't get me wrong, every season is great, and I can't wait for season 7 later this year",Positif
"Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg, less progressive material, more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it's definitely a very good one.",Positif

If you love Clay aiken you will Love this CD: Out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that Ididn't thing were appropriate for his voice. some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes. Very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately. Hopefully his next album will be just as good.,Positif
"Loaded with special features: A pretty underrated movie that would have much more acclaim if not for the ""Halloween III"" banner above the title. This disc is great for collectors as the special features are top shelf. Two audio commentaries and a half hour retrospective documentary. A solid transfer and good sound. Recommended for those who watch the extras.",Positif
Great lens: Thrilled to see the price drop and I'd been waiting for the telephoto lens for awhile. I weighed the pros and cons of getting this one for my Canon 40d vs an L series lens but decided in the end that this would do nicely in the meantime. I took some excellent shots through my kitchen window of some baby birds and was very pleased with the detail.,Positif

He doesn't give a source.",Positif

I have spilled a lot of water on the floor getting the tank back on top. Still I would recommend this dog water dish, and it can be a bit funny to watch the dogs get used to the bubbling of the water tank.",Positif
"Cliffhanger: I loved this book! It was slightly creepy at some parts, but you have to accept that. It is incredibly well written. At the end of every chapter, there is a cliffhanger. I had the hardest time putting the book down! If you listen to Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"", it is basically a little summary of the song. Just thought you'd like to know that. :)",Positif
Neuger Advances Beyond Feminism: It has been about twenty years since I have journeyed into pastoral counseling approaches to the care of women. Neuger teaches me a lesson about keeping up to date in the literature. She treats the pastoral counseling of women in much broader contexts than the early feminist literature did. I felt invited to journey with her.,Positif
Works great!: This product does what its supposed to and fits nice and compactly in my secret trunk compartment. It takes a little longer to fill my vehicle tires but that was to be expected since it's not the heavy duty gas station pump.It's only major fault is that it is LOUD during use so would not recommend using during late/early hours unless necessary.,Positif
"Hopeful romantice: This book was loaned to me by a co-worker. I'd not read any of Wiggs's books before, so this was a good introduction. Excellent story plot, wonderful ""moral of the story"" ending. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good romance without any explicite sex scenes. A person's imagination is always better than the written word anyway!",Positif
"Brilliant film, brilliant acting!: I have never seen a Daniel Day Lewis film that wasn't a true piece of art. His acting is brilliant. Every role he plays in is so believable. Being Irish an a huge boxing fan I truly loved this film. It gave accurate information on the turmoil that is to this day going on in Ireland. A must see, even for the non boxing fans.",Positif

"Hmmmm...: Hey I'm all for gross stuff, but the part about Sitfler and the beer just made me want to puke. Oh well... The laxative joke was pretty stupid, as was the extremely overrated flute joke that I've heard about 50,000 times last summer. The Internet scene was just about the coolest thing I've ever seen in a movie. Worth it just for that if you ask me!",Positif
Climb the Ladder: For the sake of brevity I will not outline the plot. To the point; it is an excellent movie on a variety of levels; but foremost it excells in the ability to convey primal and surreal emotions embedded in a disturbing and complex plot. A great performance by the cast in a film that provides a glimpse into both the dark and soft-side of man.,Positif
"A Rare Talent: Craig David's debut album, ""Born to do it."" A smash in the UK, much potential to be a smash here in the states as well.

Craig David is a rare talent, and look for great things from him in the future.",Positif
The first Berenstain Bears book.: This is the first Berenstain Bears book that I got for my daughter when I was expecting her brother.

My daughters said that when she read it to her it brought back good memories of when I read it to her. Love this book.,Positif
Athletic Director: GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!,Positif
"A Magical Tale: I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun, delightful read. Tolkien was obviously the narrator, and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle. The story moved along quite nicely, as it was short, and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle. I would recommend that everyone should read this - it's a classic!",Positif
"high society: This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years, and some people owe them great debts of gratitude. Like many later stories, this is largely set in Westchester County. There is a definite affinity with P. G. Wodehouse in the mixture of accuracy and escapist fantasy.",Positif
"great scary movie from wes craven!: I find this movie very well done, it has a lot of scenes that would probably at least make you a little bit scared. This film has good acting by Heather Langenkamp(Nancy Thomson) and Johnny Depp(Glenn) and by Robert Englund(freddy). If you are in the mood to watch a horror film then this is one film that you should not miss",Positif
"Amazing: The content, research, and intellect that went into this very detailed book is nothing short of amazing. Very deep and extemely well written, you will find you cannot stop in the middle.

"Locke gave a thorough understanding for society.: I thought that this book did a good job of explaining the role of the society and of the government. It also sets up a State of Nature to justify the State. It tells the role of the individual, and the rights entitled to the individual upon entering the State. I enjoyed this book, and enjoy Locke's philosophy.",Positif
"Very well written: One of the best as far as romance novels. Very well written with a very moving plot.

The heroine is the only one to help him, even when everyone else has given him up to the insane asylum.",Positif
"wonderful book: Wow. I can't believe this book is still around and that I found it! When I was in 1st-3rd grade I would go into the school library everyday and read this book.

"Like peanut butter: While most of this album has escaped my memory over the years, the haunting melodies and lyrical angst on ""darklands"" has stuck in my brain like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. I'm buying the album again, this time on disc, to replace my ruined cassette. I recall it as decent but the ""darklands"" track is worth the price by itself.",Positif
"Good Book: This book is about a 13 year old boy named Brian going to the Canadian Wilderness to see his father. On the way there the plane he is in crashes. So he is stuck in the woods and must survive. He learns how to build a shelter, cook food, kill animals, etc. This book is action packed and very interesting. It made me always wonder what'll happen next.",Positif
"Just a excellent movie: This movie had to be the best love story I have seen in a long time. Its not so much a love story though, its kind of hard to explain. I think sean connery and catherine zeta jones were at their best. I mean it is so neat how they have these well thought out plans. Its a little sad at the end, but its a good ending and unexpected also.",Positif
"Funny but typical: This seems to follow a typical pattern of Danny Kaye movies: a zero turns into a hero. However, you'll also find laughable moments like Kaye's other works. It's funny, but it's not one of his best movies. If you could see this for free, I'd recommend watching it. Otherwise, you might want to watch one of Kaye's other, higher quality movies.",Positif
"Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price.

"A rebuttal ...: ... to Jazzie of Hampstead, London. Don't know what you were looking at. Your last graf, where you make up some quote from Lou at the end of the show, is totally bogus. In fact, Lou says just the opposite. Pay no attention to that innacurate review. Lou has his good nights and his bad nights. This was one of the best performances of his career.",Positif
cd review: The classic Oscar Peterson Trio makes jazz music like no other and the quality of this re-mastering is exceptional. As an audiophile I can't recommend this cd highly enough. It has become one of my reference cd's. The opening cut has some of the best recorded bass I've ever heard and the other instruments are equally well represented. Buy and enjoy.,Positif
"Let It Be Fantastic: Let It Be was a great album to be The Beatles' last. The songs somewhat show that it is the end. My favorite song is ""The Long And Winding Road"". The music touches your heart and sends you a message. This is one of their best works. I, like most people, wish that The Beatles never broke up. Their music is fantastic and this album shows it.",Positif
"You Must Buy this Book!: If you have any interest whatsoever in learning the true occult science as taught by the ancient mystery schools, then this is the definitive text. It's serious and erudite.

"Lonely, depressing, eerie: I enjoyed this movie -- not because it made me giggle, but because it made me feel something. There are some plot holes big enough to drive a lunar harvester through, but they don't distract from the over-arching theme. Pretty well done. Kevin Spacey did a bang-up job voicing the 'bot; his smooth voice translates well into monotones.",Positif
"An absolutely superb release.: This recording has something for everyone. To be sure, the songwriting is strong and varied throughout, the production is great, and it is very sensual.

Highly recommended.",Positif
"Great Book at an unbeatable price: To own one of (IMHO) the essential books on modern logic and philosophy for FREE is fantastic. It is thick going at times, but that's philosophy for you.

"Good CD Player, but third-rate headphones.: This CD player is a great one when it comes to travel and portability. But only four months after I got it, the headphones stopped working (properly). When they do work, they don't work on the left side, and you usually have to play around with it before it does. But still, it's a great system. Nice audio quality, too.",Positif
"Great science videos.: My children love these videos. Although they are just 7 and 9 years old, they learn something everytime they watch any of them - and so do I! These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us. We purchased the 19 DVD setMoody Science Classics: 19-DVD Set, and it was well worth it!!!",Positif
"A great lesson for the creation and extension of jazz singin: What a pleasure to listen to this album. Five CD's take some time go through but it is worth every minute. The way this album is assembled is pure genuis by Prof. O'Meally. This album should be enjoyed by young adults as well and up to senior's. If one doesn't enjoy this album, one must be brain dead.",Positif
Grandson loves it.: Our grandson has an acute ability for solving puzzles. At 18 months old we saw him put together wooden puzzles that were age appropriate for 2 and 3 year old children. This puzzle is more of a challenge for him as he has mastered 3 of the latches and he loves trying to manipulate the others. It is very educational as it also teaches counting.,Positif
"Worth 5 stars: This is the best book in statistical quality control. A very good start for undergraduates. However, problems are not suitable for mathematicians because they are very very simple. The logic behind quality control is best presented in this book. I wish the author can increase the number of problems in this book by adding some difficult excercises.",Positif
"Loved It!!!: I saw Gunslinger Girl, Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino, and the two OVAs. I truly enjoyed the whole anime series and experienced catharsis by watching it. It dealt with deep emotions, ethics, and loss. It is sad if you only watch the first season (though it was really good), but the two OVAs give the story closure and ends on a hopeful and healed note.",Positif
Thumbs up for Mommy's Helper: I was looking for something to keep my little one from sticking things in the electrical outlets. I was pleased to find this cheap package of outlet plugs.

"Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon: This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie. It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots. Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens. Overall, excellent for adults and recommended.",Positif
"A wonderful story: Joel Vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life, and painting a word-picture that makes you feel like you're there.

There are times when you'll laugh out loud, and others when you'll find good, solid information about hunting, guns or dogs.",Positif
"Excellent strategy game!: I got this game for my birthday (I'm 35) and I love it! It's like a high-tech version of chess. Definitely makes you think hard and try to plot out your moves many steps in advance. It's especially tricky because you have to simultaneously think offensively and defensively. If you like classic strategic boardgames, you'll love this game.",Positif
"Good book for a new developer: I've been trying to make the jump from hotshot user to developer since my job has me developing applications for other users, and I've tried a couple of Access books that just didn't cover all the bases for turning a fairly advanced user into a developer. I liked this one because I thought it did an understandable job of doing this.",Positif

We won't be able to pass it on to little brother but may buy him his own...",Positif
"Director cuts out the good stuff: I have to disagree with the director and with Amazon. The voice-over was great and lent character and atmosphere to the original. Of course, the ending is better and there are some interesting new scenes with Sean Young and Harrison Ford, but Ford's voice and the Vangelis score melded into a wonderful future film noir experience.",Positif
"This book is an excellent research resource.: After researching for years and looking desperately for a good resource on Women in the Celtic times, this book was an amazing find.

Well made product at fair price: I purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensive.The auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials. I have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected. This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.,Positif

"Worth watching: The movie was well done and dramatic. The acting was good, although one could tell it was sectarian.My one main criticism is that the story did not portray the decisive factor in Luther's conversion - Justification by faith alone - sufficiently. This was the lynchpin and pivotal doctrine that separated Luther from the Catholic church and the papacy.",Positif

Bad Monkey is good: I am not a serious guitar player. What I mean is I don't get paid to play. But I do like the sounds I can make with this pedal and the distortion pedal I previously purchased.

He's smart he tapped into the whole urban sound which helped push him over the top...good for him. Give the man credit it's a good cd.",Positif

"The funniest movie I have ever seen!: I am very skeptical of comedy. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The American mass-media concept of what is ""funny"" rarely, if ever, appeals to me.

My All-Time Favorite Book: Jane Eyre is a wonderful masterpiece! I absolutely love it. The characters are so well drawn that you become one with Jane and everything she feels and endures.

"Necesary for any collection: Enormously entertaining and witty. This work is quite skeptical yet realistic and any one with even the smallest collection of books should dare not exclude this.

Great Suspensful Drama: This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along.

Too bad for the Dewalt at Home Depot, I'm glad i went with the Portamate online.",Positif
"GOod, but sometimes cheesy: In each track of this album, there's a different band formation, composed of Gary's guest musicians like Glenn Hughes, Neil Carter & Phil Lynott. It contains big sucess of his career, like ""Out in the Fields"" and ""Military Man"". It's an irregular record, however, and it's not on of his best.

"Individuality coupled with Tradition: Words can only do a disservice to the scope and deep emotion that this album not only invokes, but also infuses in its listeners.Listening to this one remembers the strength and power personified in the great Sojourner Truth's epochal poem, ""Ain't I A Woman.""Listen to it yourself and you will see...you sure are a woman Lauryn Hill.",Positif
"Stamina Electronic Mini-Stepper: The stepper is tough to use at first but that's probably because I'm out of shape. I've used it several times but not on a regular basis. The only probably I have is that it's hard to maintain your balance at times. Otherwise, it's a great little exercise medium for the price and I like it because it's small enough to put away anywhere.",Positif
"Where to purchase this book (and PDF) online...: This book (under the name ""MMURTL V1.0"") can be found on Sensory Publishing's website:http://www.sensorypublishing.com/mmurtl.htmlYou can purchase a PDF of the book (and the source of the OS itself), or pay extra for a printed copy in addition to the PDF.

"The definitive exploration of fantasy writing in our time.: Robert Jordan continues his complex tale of Rand , the Dragon Reborn, a man born to save the world and in doing so scorch it beyond recognition. In this book, Rand continues his struggle against waiting maddness and ever more determined foes, while the Dark One begins seeding the land with chaos. A must Read!!",Positif
"Good Start - Predictable Finish: This film had some very intriquing elements to it. Kate Winslet was solid and Kevin Spacey was excellent. The direction by Alan Parker gave it the eerie elements that keep you uneasy throughout. However, as the story unfolds it becomes somewhat predictable where it is heading. This cheapens the ending but the film is still worth seeing.",Positif
"Spirit Filled Experience: This DVD is powerful and filled with the anointing. With Michael W. Smith as the vehicle of praise, he fills the room with worship. It becomes contagious and the audience catches on fire, and in turn although the viewer is not physically present the fire passes on to them. It is a magnificent dvd in that respect. Everyone should experience it.",Positif
"An Irresistible Winning Comedy! Halarious!: This movie si really funny and one of the best of 1997, it is very original and it gets it's laugh in a very unique and honest way. The acting is great and the actors are perfectly cast, the accents are a bit heavy, but you can still understand. I recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for a good comedy and a good time.",Positif
"A writer's book: This is a book about becoming real in a world of unreal people. Not many of London's regular fans liked this book, a little too real for them I suppose. But, writers love this book and with good reason. If you write and haven't read this, put it in your shopping cart right now. If you're looking for a classic Jack London adventure story, skip this one.",Positif
"Without question, one of the most complete movies I've seen.: I can only add my voice to the choir of accolades for this thought provocing, moving film. Few films are as complete in every respect in which a movie can be. I have searched for a copy of this film for five years, and can but wonder why films of much less repute are released while this epic is kept from us.",Positif
"sketches of AFI: now that AFI has become an opverproduced studio crap-fest, Thought Riot picks up where they left off. both this and Shattered Mirror Syndrome remind me of AFI's ""answer that and stay fashionable"", which is nice considering all the wanna-be NOFX bands that have run amock since the mid 90's. in essence, it's hard and fast, as it should be. check 'em out.",Positif
Great Shoe: I have wide feet. They are true to size. I can even sleep in them. I walk and stand sometimes 12 hrs. This shoe is light weight and comfortable.

I am exceptionally happy with my purchase.,Positif
"One of my all time favorites!: I've used this CD for years: naptime, massage, candle lit showers & bedtime. These showers are so awesome... that I gave this CD and the Thunderstorms CD for variety along with instructions for a divine experience to all my sisters! XO! Did I mention someone ""forgot to return"" this CD to me... so I went out and bought it for the 2nd time!",Positif
"Interesting look at homelessness: Less a ""romance of freighthopping"" and more just vignettes of homelessness in various places. Ted's writing was a good match for his subject matter. Ted mentioned that one of the reasons for the demise of hoboing was the prosperity of the '90s. That situation is being reversed...Go to Northbank Fred's website for some of the adventure.",Positif
"Different than cover displayed: I had began to read this book borrowed from a distant friend last summer but didn't get it finished.

Book arrived within specified time. Over pleased.",Positif
"Practical and helpful for almost anyone.: While aimed more for romantic relationships, especially marriage, its a great book for everyone. It gives clear and practical definitions and examples of the way humanity express and receives love. Though some of it would seem common sense, the light bulb goes on as its described in new ways. Good read and worth buying to keep.",Positif
"Better than the first: wow this cd is The best. It might have some bad songs but Gatman that was funny and My toy soldier is a great song along with outta control, disco inferno , god gave me style which is sorta lyk his 21 question thang but this cd to me was great i dunt care bout all your otha opinions but this cd was the best cd so far produced by someone in g-unit",Positif
"A good mystery novel for young readers: A very quick read, probably because it was intended for the young adult reader. That being said, this is a good book for said audience, with just the right amount of all the elements that make up a mystery novel, while letting more of the important values stand out - family, friendship, forgiveness, letting go and moving forward.",Positif
Bought two of these curling irons in one week.: This curling iron is great because of the 5/8 barrel.Its perfect for fine medium length hair.Why this size is so hard to find is beyond me....Helen of Troy makes the best curling iron have replaced most of mine with Helen of Troy..Received the product quickly and will re-order in the near future for other beauty products.,Positif
"Classic: Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!",Positif
"Well Done: I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform ""Invisible"" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well.",Positif
"Great Book, I couldn't put it down: After you get a few chapters into the book, it grabs you. You get so into it that every time you put it down, all you can think about is the book. This was also one of those books that your sad when it ends because you want to read more of it. Good thing there is 2 more! This is a must read for all fantasy and science fiction readers!",Positif
"Excelente, como todos los libros de él.: Es una lectura muy amena, para el que sabe un poco del idioma astrológico, sin embargo es fácil de leer, y el libro a diferencia de otros de SA está escrito de una forma más informal debido a que es tipo conferencias de pregunta y respuesta.Es un excelente complemento para el otro libro del mismo autor Person to Person Astrology.",Positif
"Nice album for the sad times: Hefner is really awesome. If you listen ""Love will destroy us in the end"" you may find the most sensitive, yet funny, song of the album and it's quite surprising that a band can do that without using epic arrangements with horns and all that stuff. I recommend this album because no one has this one and i'd love to talk about it with anyone.",Positif
A TRULY UNDERATED COMEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have no idea why this movie did as bad as it did. In my opinion it was a truly fun film. It had a great mix of sports gags and situational comedy. Matt Stone And Trey Parker had so much fun doing this. I could not stop laughing at Dian Bachar. He was incredibly funny as Squeak. Don't miss out on this film. Funniest movie of 1998.,Positif
"resurect E.1999: Dear Mr. Ougi, There has never been a group that could flow like Bone. Eazy got it right when he put those guys together. All thuggish Bone fans will love this album.

"An excellent biography of one of Rome's greatest emperors: This book is an excellent overview of the life of one of the Roman Empire's greatest rulers.

"BORING, BAD ACTING, NOT REALISTIC, AWFUL: This movie is not worth seeing. Don't waste your time, and go for the newer productions. In the time the movie was made they certainly did not know what they were doing.",Negatif
Things kind of got crazy...: ...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.,Negatif
"Running With Scissors: Polarizing performance by Annette Benning. Great cast that followed the story-line as true to the acclaimed novel as possible. An abstract story, entertaining in nature but drags its feet.",Negatif

Its not good.: This is only good if you are absolutly desperate. The monitor you hook it up to will not show color and it constantly has a darker bar running down it. There is no sound at all so thats of no use.,Negatif
Not worth the money!: It didn't provide any more information than the instruction manual that came with the camera did. Only advantage is the size and shape of the book which feels nicer than holding the manual.,Negatif
Nice tools but poor quality: I love my pink tools. The only thing is that the name on the handle has dissapeared?? I made spagetti and the spoon got stained with tomatoe sauce. That is why I am very dissapointed,Negatif

"Cyberspace and the Media: Another interesting view on cyberspace, this takes on the media's impact on this evolving medium. Worth borrowing for most. If you are a public affairs type you might want to even buy it.",Negatif

"Elizabeth the Silly School Girl: A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong. Why not just make up a story with no historical basis?",Negatif
dog bone: Not for a dog that chews...which is all of them. But especially aggressive chewers like my 10 month old terrier. Big chunks come off and get swallowed. That can't be good for them. Steer away from these.,Negatif

Bad design - drives me crazy: Push buttons on the rim are exposed and active even when the cover is closed. They cannot be disabled. These buttons control ring profiles so that the phone will change to silent without warning.,Negatif
poor quality: These pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area. For this price I would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months.,Negatif

"Meh ...: This book redefines derriviative. It seems like the sort of fan fiction where the writer goes in to other writers' worlds, kills their dragons, steals their gold, and makes out with their Arwen. This book makes a fine door-stop or paperweight, though (+1 star).",Negatif

This CD is horrible!!!: The Spice Girls need to find some talent. I don't know were but somewhere where talent is being passed out. Not only their music ( which makes no sense) but their movie was terrible. I felt robbed of my money. Take my advice DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!,Negatif

"Smells Like It's Gone Bad: I didn't read the book. But if it's as ridiculous as the movie, I don't plan to. While it's definitely a big budget production--the costumes and sets are gorgeous--I can't say I'd recommend it unless you've seen everything else Amazon has to offer.",Negatif
"Book condition: The book was listed as like new and it was not. It looked very used and since it was a gift, I wasn't happy. I thought it was a hardbound book, but that may have been my mistake. For a coupld dollars more, I could have bought a new paperback new in the store.",Negatif
Not for outdoor extensions: The description is misleading because it doesn't say it will wind up 150 ONLY if you have 16 gauge or less. Who uses an outdoor extension cord which isn't at least 14 guage.....???? Don't buy unless you have less than 100 feet of extension cord...,Negatif

"Really Dull: It's obvious they know the cameras are there, so you know they act more a fool than if they were not being filmed, aren't all realty type shows becoming this way, the more a performance you put on, the more on screen time you will get, hence it all seems an act.",Negatif
"Boring but very sexual: I really didn't think this movie was appropriate, especially under a christian label. I know-Adam and Eve and all, but I've seen porno's with less nudity than this movie. It makes eating the apple seem like a SACRIFICE compared to the rest of the sin.",Negatif
"Triad ""Remastered Edition"" of The Stranger is a lousy copy.: The Stranger is an interesting film, one of the better film noir of the era. This streaming version from Triad, described as ""remastered,"" is crap. Check out the other reviews. The MGM version has positive reviews.",Negatif

"Some of the worst writing I have ever read!: This author needs to stick to his normal genre. This was a good idea for a story line, but I felt like a 14 year old wrote it! I have read most of his other books and have enjoyed them, but I had to force myself to finish this one.",Negatif

Ugh.: A frustrating and appallingly silly book. Gaudy Night is an interminably related love story framed by an underdone mystery- perfect if you like that sort of thing. Its one redeeming value is that it gives the kind of lift to a highball you just won't get with a coaster.,Negatif
"Excellent: Like it. Love it. Live in Paris will always be in my top 5. She is a star with this incredible band. Some of her originals are too melancholy for me, but she is truly unique in her talents. Who else can compose, sing and play jazz piano like that? Who was the girl?",Negatif

Jabra Eargels: The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.,Negatif
"Love of Siam: This budding romance is a bit...slow. I was a bit disappointed with the story line but then again, I find it quite difficult for Asians to do a well coming out or coming of age story. This is my opinion. I would reccomend that you save your money and not view it.",Negatif
Horrible Shaving System: I purchased the razor and blades as the double-bladed sensor was out of stock. This is the worst design Gillette has yet put forth. The 3-blade design is much too wide and clumsy. The only shaving done with this razor system was my first layer of skin.,Negatif
"Beware! Digital flaw: Everything about this release is wonderful except that it has a manufacture digital flaw. Both our original and replacement had the exact same digital flaw, in the exact same location. Too bad that this dvd was released without getting the bugs out first.",Negatif

Weak: This cd don't even compare to Get Rich Or Die Trying. He say its better and Tony Yayo say its 10x better than the 1st one too. That's why all the stuff happened to hype it up like they did the first cd and it worked. But this cd is WEAK so don't waste your time or money.,Negatif

"By-The-Numbers Load of Blech!: This movie is nothing but a cliched creepfest whose laughable storyline consists of Richard Gere pining after some young girl. If the plot doesn't creep the heck out of you, the movie itself will lull you to sleep. Avoid this DVD like the plague!",Negatif

"The Girl Who Loved T.G. & Wasted My Time: I had not read any Stephen King and picked up this novel as a sample. A huge disappointment. The story is weak and contains little suspense. Given the nature of his success, I assume this work is not indicative of Mr. King's abilities.",Negatif

"Just a mishmash of hype: 12 Monkeys is a very tedious film. Even once you realize whats really going on, you don't care. It's like one of the movies you might see at a hotel (actually where I saw it), cheap and made for cable. The only thing good about the film is Bruce Willis.",Negatif
"Bull Shit: I do not watch television on a schedule, so I miss a lot of programming. It is good that television shows are available on disk now. And it is handy for review later. Penn & Teller use scientific facts to support, or destroy common beliefs and opinions. This is good.",Negatif

"Awful: This film had the foulest language I have ever heard, it is not worth the plastic it is on. The movie has no point. The ending has no point. It is not even a good stock flick, it has nothing to do with wall street. Not even worth a buck rental. watch Wall Street instead.",Negatif

"OMG, this is a slow starter...zzz...zzz: I like all kinds of movies...action, drama, comedy, romance, documentary, etc. I have an attention spam beyond that of many. But when I watch an action film I want action and it took 90 minutes to get there on a thin plot line. Painful. .",Negatif
"Save Your Money: So awful you have to laugh to keep from crying. The dialogue is almost impossible to listen to, the acting is wooden and at times ridiculous, and the special effects are very, very dated. It reminded me of the old ""Lost in Space"" TV program, and that isn't good.",Negatif

"Confusing even if you are not an idiot: This book is poorly organized and confusing. The authors used way too many quotations from other sources, i.e. books, websites. In the end, I have to wonder what the authors' own take is on the subject. It doesn't have a backbone of its own, period.",Negatif
Book Critic2: I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.,Negatif

Poor DVD transfer: The transfer to DVD is very poor (worse I have seen yet). There are so many artifacts in the video as well as black portions of the letter box that is can be quite distracting. The movie is a great movie but save the dough and by it on VHS or see in when it is on cable.,Negatif

"Gagged: I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out 1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher, it would have been returned with a rejection form letter.",Negatif
"Interesting, but Halting: An interesting book, I found myself reading and rereading entire passages. Not only because I enjoyed the text, but also because the translation was sometimes so awkward that I had trouble making sense of some sections.

Save Your Money: I agree with Jeff's review below. The sound on this thing is horrific. It's mega-compressed and overly bright. The more they mess with this album. the worse it sounds.

"Visually stunning. But a terriable movie: BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black, which automatically makes it bad. But the drawn-out story just makes it worse.On the positive side, it looks good. HD-DVD is a winner. And the fairly reasonably priced XBox 360 HD-DVD adapter is well worth every penny.",Negatif
"Not the best: Wether this verson has been updated and cleaned up, doesn't really matter.What I've seen is a very poor recording, very bad sound (that makes it hard to hear what is being said),and bad picture quality.A film from the master of suspence should be given the recognition it deserves.",Negatif
"Not worth it, get metal...: In just a short time, even by only hand washing, expect all the labels to be barely readable. It's just not worth it.

Hard to follow: My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it.

Rent before you Buy: What a bad movie. Pitch Black was great but this mess doesn't even come close. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I didn't watch the entire movie.

I teach AP Biology and I am so glad I picked up a copy to check out before I asked my students to. This book is still written for the old exam and is a complete waste of money.",Negatif
"Singularly centered: The whole story appears to revolve around this huge ""love triangle"" of Gatsby trying to get Daisy to come back to him and leave Tom. Upon close scrutiny of Gatsby's actions it would appear that they all are leading up to how he could meet Daisy again. The main theme of the story.",Negatif
disappointing: The fan boys would have you believe that this movie was good... and if you think it wasn't then you are stupid and just didn't understand it.I understood it. It was a serious disappointment. The first movie was so good compared to the second and third movies.Rent it - once is enough...,Negatif
"Citizen Kane is a very poor movie, but it's not definitely the worst film ever!: The worst film of all time would be Plan 9 from Outer Space. Even Citizen Kane is more boring than Plan 9, tt doesn't mean that it's worse. It's just one of those films people feel that they waste their time watching it.",Negatif
Do not buy if you want to unroll your cable partially: The reel has no hole in the middle to pass extension cord through so you might unroll it partially.So you will need either unroll the cord completely and use the reel just as a storage or make the hole manually.That's what you have for the price.,Negatif
Needs a mind of its own: I thought the beginning of the book was great. There were many details and lots of descriptive language. I had no idea where it was going to until about the last 5 chapters when i knew it was an almost complete replica of Cinderella. The ending shoud've ended more individual.,Negatif
"What a waste: Ms. Rice has lost her ability to write, keeps churning out junk.Hopefully her ""turn to Jesus"" won't make people sick as well.This wasn't worth the price paid, especially if you enjoyed ""Interview with the Vampire/Vampire Listat."" It's a put down of her earlier works, when she was fresh.",Negatif
"Not long-lived: I've had this dvd player about 16 months now. I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of use when it worked, but now it randomly opens, stops and plays on its own. I can't watch movies on it anymore since it opens by itself every 30 seconds or so. A real disappointment!",Negatif

"Not A Good Movie: This film, about an address book killer that gets in a car wreck and whose soul goes online during a freak storm while getting a cat scan, is horrible and predictable. The movie is sterile looking with a bad look and feel. It was suspensless and extremely un-entertaining. Skip this.",Negatif
"The Black & Decker Chopper Plus.: The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than 1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product. I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one, but I had lost the blade to it and had to purchase this one.",Negatif

Looks like success has ruined Diana Krall: I heard her in concert a few months ago. She was great. Where have the hard driving piano improvs and innovative swinging vocals gone? 'The Look of Love' is very little jazz (mostly pop) with maple syrup poured all over it. I hope it didn't ruin my CD player!,Negatif
"faded glory: I heard this CD initially from a friend's burned off copy, and it sounded bad.

I guess the CD just sucks, because it sounds just like my friend's burned copy, bad.",Negatif
"Not my kind of movie.: Too slow, not much going on. I couldn't even finish it. There was no character study, no plot that I could see, nothing.

"Not the best Reacher: An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable ""twist"", especially as Reacher books go. And there are some scenes that make almost ZERO sense. If you're a Reacher addict, you'll read it anyway. If you're not, save your time and money.",Negatif
"I would not buy it again: At first, I thought this was a pretty good deal. I figured I could tolerate the somewhat cheap, plastic appearance because of the favorable price.

Just ok: I used it for the first time last night. Worked well as far as the pounding part but I put it in the dishwasher and it came out dull with lots of gray stuff rubbing off.

"Nasty compilation of good books...: You're much better off going to the original books this compilation rips off. There are editing mistakes galore in this volume, and the editor adds nothing new (except some typos). I'd sell mine as a used book but I don't want to rip off someone else with this trash.",Negatif
"Good marketing, bad book: The ""rave"" reviews here sound like industry blurbs, and there isn't anything really new worth your money.

Junk!!: This thing is JUNK! After crushing only 4....yes 4 cans it snapped in two. Way over priced for the quality. It's nothing but plastic. I would recommend spending a lot less on a different product...which will probably quarantee at least more than 4 total cans crushed over the life of the product.,Negatif

The previous comment on poor editing is well founded...the number of blantant printing and typographical errors is astounding.",Negatif
"I didn't enjoy reading Frugal Families.: I love Jonni McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms! It has so much information and recipes that I have read it several times! And give copies of it as gifts.

Worst Purchase!: I had to return this book. It is outdated compared to the other bible dictionaries out there. I wouldn't waste my time purchasing this book. It doesn't contain much information.

Typical King. Slow and poorly written.: It is hard to believe that this man has been so successful. This is the fourth book I've read by King and (of those four) only The Green Mile was any good.

Average Book: The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT).

A poor book: The book is full of little actions and descriptions which don't have much meaning in the story.

"This one is not worth reading.: I bought this book second-hand, thank goodness. I have read a few chapters and will not continue. This is simply trash. The characters are not worth the time. As another reviewer said, this time period is interesting, but this book is not. It does not ring true and the people are boring.",Negatif
I threw it in the trash in one day!: I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is riddled with new-age and eastern mysticism. It is lacking any solid documentation for the author's claims which are so outlandish it was hard to believe anyone would publish this book. I was truly disappointed. Don't bother buying it.,Negatif

"Terrible graphics, OK recipes: As soon as I opened this book, I didn't want to make any of the recipes, simply because the pictures were so awful.

Borrow it from the library if you have to...: I would strongly suggest that you do not buy this book until you have had a chance to borrow it from the library and skim through it.

Great Concert - Bad DVD: I have had this concert on VHS for almost 20 years and have been waiting for the DVD. I just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync. The sound and picture are about a second off from each other. Did anyone else encounter this problem or did I just get a bad DVD.,Negatif
"Phone Cover: Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain.",Negatif
Product is misrepresented: This item is misrepresented in the description.

"Wow... this is one awful CD: I was hoping to be blown away by Mr. Cornell's cannon of a voice, but instead found myself falling asleep to uninspired lyrics and down right awful music. All you have to do is look at the pictures of Chris in the booklet to realize this Knight of the Soundtable has lost his way. Avoid this one like the plague.",Negatif
"How can anyone take this seriously?: Lyrically, Cornell sounds like a sub-literate 14 year old scribbling deep thoughts in a spiral notebook: hideous.

( Why do you need it if you are already versed anyway?)",Negatif
Too gaudy: Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.Bought this light fixture for our daughters room.

"Don't do it!: This is not the Seagal of the early nineties. Something has happened to him and it's not good. He's gained weight, does not move like before, and is hard to understand. The technical process is terrible. I will never buy another Seagal (I have 14 of the old ones) again and I think Amazon should seriously consider taking this off their site.",Negatif
Monitor doesn't last long: We loved this monitor until a little over a year after we started using it (of course after warranty expired). The picture got increasingly worse and smaller so that now (two years later)it is a 1/4 inch strip across the monitor. We can only use it for sound now. We are definately purchasing a different brand for the next baby.,Negatif
Electric pump failed: Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job.

"This doesn't deserve one star: This is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The cheese is laid on entirely too thick, and everything about Sparks's style reminds of the books my 12-year-old sister reads.

Not as Good as the Original!!!: More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones.

Not worth the time!: This is the one book by Stephen King I could not finish. Usually his books grab me from the first paragraph but this one held no interest at all. I quit about a 1/4 of the way through and didn't even care enough to turn to the back pages to find out how it ended.King has only left me disapointed once before and that was with Gerald's Game.,Negatif
one time cooker: This rice cooker is good for one time cooking. The rice does not last more than 12 hours. I usually leave my rice for 4 days so that I do not have to keep cooking it (lazy). I returned it and bought Cukoo rice cooker (made in Korea). The rice lasts for 4 days without changing color or get old. Cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.,Negatif
A clas-sick that made me sick: This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers,Negatif

"Bad TV ??: Being a science fiction fan (versus medical fiction fan), I found the first part of the book interesting and exciting, albeit some of the character development was weak.

"Fire and Ice: The Korean War: This book read like a reference book. There was a dry history of the Korean campaign, followed by chapters on armaments, ranks and insignias, contributing military groups, etc., with lots of statistics.

"Don't believe the hype!: I love Spike Lee movies --- ""Do the right thing,"" ""The 25th Hour,"" and ""Clockers, but this book by Kaleem Aftab is shallow and meanders to the point of infuriating.

It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk, so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap. You get what you pay for I suppose, but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $20.",Negatif

The only guy who made the movie ok enough not to snore in the theater was the guy who played satan. From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible ignorance. The taking out of scriptures was real bad.",Negatif
"Dont buy, rent if you really want to see it: While I did enjoyed the beginning of this, it soon got to the point that it was far to easy to guess everything about to happen, and I was fighting to stay awake watching it.Very sad also when the devil with all his powers, which he shows in the film, cant beat a drunk who wants to kill himself.One of the worst by Arnold.",Negatif
"visitor: I was really expecting a great cd. I heard Miss Independent and was really looking forward to the rest of the cd. If I want that type of quality for a whole cd, then I guess I will have to stick to Christina. It isn't a terrible cd, just not a great one. Her vocals are good, which become great with studio touchups, but the songs are just boring and lacking.",Negatif

The third time I plugged in the AC adapter it failed to light up that it was getting power. I swapped out the 3 prong AC cord and tried other wall sockets. Absolutely pathetic quality on the AC adapter.",Negatif
"Okay - but very pricey for what I got: The mirror is excellent - almost too much magnification - but the apparatus that extends and holds the mirror is stiff, not great in the adjustment department, and it is very expensive for what I got, in my opinion. I will be surprised if it will last and work very well for more than a year - used not for travel but in my home.",Negatif
"Give me a break!: If you're looking for a good baseball read, look further. The absolute twerpiness of George Will comes across in this book. It's clear that when he was a youngster, he was the nerdy kid in the schoolyard. This is the typical example of a pinheaded intellectual trying to sound like an average Joe by writing about sports. Give me a break George Will!",Negatif

"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc: Well as a student of History, this movie is to say the least, pittiful. The acting is so bad some of the fighting sequences are laughable. The young women who plays Joan, should go back to acting school, she only seems to have two levels crazy, and crazy screaming. The only good thing about the film were the sets and costumes.",Negatif
"Bogus, package labeled correctly: Whole family loved the first when viewed in 2011, it is aging well.

Leaves much to desire: The book provides a good chart of all of the Outlook 2000 objects but gives few good programming examples. Nowhere does it show how to login as an outlook user and then create and send an email. Spends too much time on the Outlook database vs. task list as if it were the only part of Outlook a developer would be interested. Not worth the money.,Negatif
"This movie was really bad...: Sorry, but I thought this movie was horrible. Only two other movies are on my list for horrible movies, and this is one of them. Schwarzenegger was completely mis-cast in this movie. The acting was horrible. I can't believe Gabriel Byrne wasted his time on this movie. Save your money and spend it on Stigmata. It is a much better movie...",Negatif

A shell of their former self.",Negatif
"violent right wing extremist garbage: The worst book i've read in a long long time. very bad editing, and completly subjugated to the reactionary and ultra right wing political agenda of Clancy. It tells us that the only way to be a real man is to have a male child and that women are only good for having children and quailing before the macho superiorty of their men.",Negatif
Not the one in the picture.: They dont send you the one in the picture. The end that plugs into the (whatever)-pod is much larger. It wont fit with some cases. Not really a problem for me but buyer beware. Also the plug that goes into the (whatever)-pod is made of plastic instead of metal. The whole cord seems cheep but it at 2 bucks for 3 of them its not a bad deal.,Negatif

I gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm, and has an attractive weave.",Negatif
"great songs, horrible sound transfer: It is simply not worth wasting your money even on songs of the sixties so fine as these, since the sound qualities of this disc are so poor as to completely ruin the listening experience.

Buyer Beware: It's no fault of Amazon but please beware before purchasing this title. This was a good movie and it's a shame no one has restored it yet. I really expected it to be much better.

Only worse -- compression artifacts, tiling with squares the size of Post-it Notes, banding that looks like 16-bit grayscale. It made the whole thing unwatchable for me. [...]",Negatif

Pointless and depressing: I thought that I was doing ok financically until I read this book. There is little or no financial insight or direction to this book.I really never got the point.

There are about 2 funny moments in this film and even then I found myself embarrassed about laughing (well, sniggering) at them.",Negatif

fast to slow page turner: I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for.

"Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.",Negatif
Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.,Negatif
"Drags: I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but after a while it just drags. Could have been a nice story in the New Yorker, but as a book it just doesn't cut it. Forced my way to the end.Summary: Couple of guys want to get to this obscure place cause they like the name. Jump through lots of hoops trying to get permission. One of them dies. Permission comes. That's all folks.",Negatif
"How should I put this?: I hate this movie. Its not even a movie, more of a waste of time. I've wasting too much time writing this review already. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC! It doesn't even qualify as bad or horrible! See CITIZEN KANE a million times (no really, a million) before you see this one. If I could just leave all the stars blank, then maybe I could begin to do it justice.",Negatif
Doctor Zhivago DVD Poor Quality: I have loved Dr. Zhivago from the moment it hit the big screen but this DVD copy is of poor quality. It is cheaply produced and you discover that the movie is on both sides of the DVD. It is just disappointing. The lesson is that often when you buy cheap you get a substandard product...lesson learned. I'm going to find an old VHS copy to watch.,Negatif
"Very Weak Study Guide: I have been advised by those who help others prepare for the CSET that this is not a good study guide. So much information and so overwhelming and not all the answers are accurate.I studied the books What your 6-8th grader needs to know.....I did that for math, geography, ca history etc etc and passed the CSET on the first try.

"Piece of junk: This pan went into the garbage after the first use. I bought this to replace an older model that scratched after years of use. We made one omelette which stuck terribly to the pan. Once we got it out of the pan, we noticed the pan had warped. In all the years we had the other one, this never happened. Buy a conventional omelette pan and you will be much happier.",Negatif
"Plenty of corn and schmaltz: I marvel at the way people have given this work more than one star. The sentimentality oozes out of the writing and often, for want of anything better to contribute, the author continues to dwell on small mundane scenes...The book is a shallow and inept endeavor to capture a love story and lacks the talent of a true artisan of the craft of writing.",Negatif
"An object lesson on what drugs can do to a brain: This book illustrates the effects of long-term drug and alcohol abuse far better than any lecture a parent can give. Mr. Ellis can't anymore distinguish between reality and the replays in his imagination. It's hard to feel compassion or even interest for someone who has lots of money and fame and feels so, so sorry for himself.",Negatif
"Delivery fine - Product, not so much.: Delivery was timely, and product was received in good condition, with what appeared to be original sealed plastic cover. Video portion was fine, but audio is extremely uneven and required constant adjustment during playing. I have not complained to the seller and probably won't - this is probably part of the risk in ordering DVD products.",Negatif
"The Book is Unreadable: This book has been produced in such a way that the words are unreadable. It is basically a worthless purchase, but since I don't want to fight and try to get my money back from someone that would even think about selling a product such as this, I didn't even try. How would a company that sells a product as terrible as this ever give you your money back?",Negatif

"Not useful at all!: These CD's are nothing more than someone reading the lectures in the Textbook and the Workbook, nothing more. I thought that I was buying the Student Audio Program that accompanies the Workbook, which this isn't. I suppose that someone might like listening to someone just speak the language, but that is all this is. You might as well turn on the television.",Negatif
"DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.",Negatif
"Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant.

I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund.",Negatif
"Misleading: You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection, but mostly contains fillers and short dvds. It appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted. One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons. If you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little.",Negatif
"Didn't fit properly.: I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best.

If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM.",Negatif
"Disappointed: I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house. I was hopeful this would be a great product, but unfortunately, it's not. The whole set isn't very good in quality and I figure they would probably break if you used them very heavily. I just threw the set in the garage in case every other socket I have disappears, I at least have this set as a backup.",Negatif
"Dissapointing!: Foremost, the episodes that they picked weren't all good (certainly not the ""The Very Best.."").Second, the general editing was poorly done. Third, the extra footage featuring parts of interviews previously cut out, should have never been put back in. The footage was boring and a waste of time. All, I can say is this tape is dissapointing. Don't bother to buy it.",Negatif
Don't waste your money: This album is a disaster. It deserves one star because I bought it without listening to it prior to the purchase. They turn 180 degrees away from the blues and try to rock out. My coffee cup has been resting on it on my desk after the first listen. Save your hard earned money and buy everything else they put out. The other stuff is great. This is a joke.,Negatif

"Oh, Garfield!!!: I am a fan of Garfield and I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. Maybe that is the reason that I felt let down. I guess I expected too much.

So if you are a fan of Garfield, go ahead and get it.",Negatif
"Ouch!: I like Cary Grant, but I hated this movie. The acting was OK, and there were certain scenes which were very amusing, but the constant chatter throughout the film almost drove me nuts! From beginning to end, there was so much constant talking that it seemed like I was at an auction! Very fast paced and funny in places, this is nevertheless not one of Grant's better films.",Negatif
"Madonna is so much better!!!!!!!: Madonna and Britney shouldn't even be put in the same senstence; Madge is the Queen of Pop and Britney . . . well . . . she is the Plastic Barbie Doll of Pop. This song is unremarkable. Lyrically, the song is horrendous, and the mildly infectious beat can only redeem it ever so much. Madonna should never have agreed to collaborate with Britney.",Negatif

I am definitely sending this back to Amazon so people be aware before buying this book.",Negatif
"Awful: I rented this movie from Redbox and the $1.20 I paid was too much. About 20 minutes in my boyfriend and I couldn't take it anymore.

Horrible Printing: The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable. Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes.

Overblown overhyped: You would think the the history of the artists combining for this CD would mean something new and exciting. NOT!

Huh???: This is very odd. In 1998 Garth Brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme. However for some artists that kind of treatment doesn't work and it falls flat.

I'm 64 so I've had quite a few vacuums and this is the least user friendly one I've ever owned. The only thing good about it is the retractable cord. It doesn't pick up dog hair very well and after emptying, it's a pain to get back together. I'm taking it back to Target.",Negatif
"Returned. Way too specific for my needs.: I'm a coach for an after school girls group that trains for a 5K at the end of a 12 week program. I'm a school counselor, NOT a trained coach or PE teacher. I wanted some general advice about helping my elementary girls prepare for the 5K, hydration needs, Pre race meals, etc. This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case.",Negatif
"My favorite scene: When the ""Major"" wants to rescue Jean Simmons and make war on the Hennesy's. ""Leech"" (Heston) says I can't back you on this Major and all the hands agree. When the Major starts to ride in alone, Leech jumps on his horse and catches up and gets as close as he can to support his boss. Then around the hills comes all the other hands. Heston's expression is priceless.",Negatif
"Phew...This movie stinks: Well, on the positive side this movie was clean without too much crude humor. Of course it had the gas passing humor that you find in most films of this genre. Negatively speaking this has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that I have ever seen. It just was lacking something. I never really cared if the rodents suceeded in their mission or not.",Negatif
"Supposedly for computers, NOT: As has been said, this item is a complete piece of junk. The package and labeling advertise it as a plug for use with computers and computer accessories. Except all modern computers are three pronged (ie, they have a ground). This plug does not have a female three prong US. It is thus completely useless, and I am returning both of the ones I purchased.",Negatif
Wasting your money if you buy H2Oc: If you search the internet you will find many complaints about this product.

Some funny stuff... some dull stuff... more cussin than ever and the movie lasts 2 1/2 hours. Thats 2 hours to long. The end",Negatif
"A Shame for Both Actors!: I was so excited about seeing this movie, I'm a fan of both Wilson & Hudson. But after only 10 minutes, I was extremely disappointed. In fact, after 30 minutes, I walked out. I usually don't listen to what critics have to say about movies because most of the time I like what they don't. But I would have to agree with them on this one, don't waste your time.",Negatif
"Pick another. 1001 nights better.: I like such compos by these guys as ""1001 nights"", ""Not the last goodbye"". These are truly original, rhytmical&uplifting. On this CD only 2 covers - Wild World and Nature Boy - really deserve attention. Wild World show S&S's best, it's the best track.

Horrible Song: Nelly is doing more singing than Janet Jackson is on this clunker that alone spells trouble. dime a dozen track with no feeling or meaning. this is a ok B-side but not worthy of a lead off single&especially not worthy to remember the Control project from 20 years back. but Janet Jackson has been played out for well over a Decade to me&this song only adds to that point.,Negatif

"Didn't like the commentary throughout the movie: Maybe I just didn't see it when I purchased the movie, but I wasn't aware of the director's commentary throughout the movie. It really detracted from the presentation. Also his comments seemed almost off the cuff and didn't ahve a lot of forethought in them. At anyrate, it might have been my error, but whatever, the commentary was bad.",Negatif

Any more than 2 stars and you are just an Amy worshiper.: She has a killer voice and backed up with the real world passion of her origional back was a match made in heaven.

It makes great mall/elevator music though.,Negatif
Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.,Negatif
"Not for me.: This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading for a day or two, I found that it was too scattered and hard to follow.

If you have read this book you might have noticed that the main charactor, Eragon, is knocked out during all but one battle scene.

WHY DO WRITERS DO THIS??: This is an okay book in terms of the man's life (most info is culled from other sources) but when it comes to Denzel Washington's career the author commits an unpardonable sin.

90 minutes gone from my life: As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this.

I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.,Negatif
"Heavy handed: While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical exposÉ. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson.",Negatif
"A Rambling Mess: I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking.

"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY: THE worst! Washington and Hawke exchange badly scripted rants in performances no better than those found in really wretched community theatre.

Yuck: Tiny Tim was in my opinion a very talented individual but his talent seems sorely lacking in this rather sad collection of Christmas songs.

"High expectations unmatched by reality: After all of Meryl Streep's successes we had just about concluded that If Meryl Streep was in the movie, it would be a winner especially when you add in the rest of the remarkable cast.

The band sux: I love the watch although the self winding feature causes some accuracy problems. A few minutes a week fast. The real disppointment is the band.

"This is a miss: This book could be about 25% the length that it is, one of the most overhyped books out there. Guns, germs and steel is one aspect of the results that have been produced,honestly it is a little simple-minded and/or an overenthusiastic but unobservant author.

I guess Van Halen asked themselves that question, or at least should have.",Negatif
"Not a good representation of conservatism...: As a conservative, I must say that this book left a bad taste in my mouth. The public's perception of the Republican Party as ""mean spirited"" comes from works precisely as this one, which aim to only attack, and really offer nothing substantive to say.

Incorrect parts in package: I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing.

It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead.",Negatif
"It does the job: If you can't hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn't be a game within a game.",Negatif
"Poor stitching, doesn't hold up: I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed",Negatif
"Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries, I discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment. Additionally, I found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced. I returned this item.",Negatif
"Somebody shoot me.................please: Jennifer Love Hewitt is the only bright spot in this mind dulling dribble. The script leaves you not caring for the characters.

If you like daydreaming buy this DVD, because you'll be so bored your mind will be wandering in thousands of directions.",Negatif
No No and No.: Ok. I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud! All the time! Trying too darn hard to be funny! I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL. I don't know if I am just outgrowing stage plays but I am pretty sure it's the character Aunt Bam throwing me off with her loudness. Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious. Bring it down a couple notches.,Negatif
"Falls Short: It was disappointing to discover that this CD falls short of all the praise it seems to get in these reviews, but with songs like When I'm 64, Within You Without You, Fixing A Hole, and Benefit of Mr. Kite, I just have to be honest.Some of the other songs are good (A Day in the Life) but one song doesn't save an album. Some Beatle albums are better, like Help, but this is only about a 2-star CD.",Negatif

"Beware! Take care...: Had Timothy Hines and Susan Goforth put as much creative energy into this movie as they have with the numerous bogus reviews they've allegedly planted here and at the IMDB, this version of ""The War of the Worlds"" would have been highly entertaining. Sadly, they've presented viewers with an overly long and amateurish effort that has deservedly earned the scorn of most who have viewed it.",Negatif
"Terrible: You know it's bad when you can't even get worked up enough to care when the dog's die. This maybe the worst movie I have ever seen.

A high school drama/film class could have put on a better production. Stick with the book. Seriously.",Negatif
"Pass on this one: I dont care how many kids you have or how long you've been programming for, this book just doesn't cover the subject of Perl very well.

Let's all hope next year's six-hour TV rendition is vastly better than this mess of a movie.",Negatif
"Not what I'd hoped: Steve Martin has always been among my favorite comic actors and performers, so I greatly looked forward to this book. Unfortunately I found it practically unreadable. Perhaps my taste in humor has changed, but there always seemed to be an edge to the silliness in Martin's performances. The edge is missing here. I don't abandon many books without finishing them, but this is one that I did.",Negatif
A horrible book: I thought that this was a bad book because i think it was very boring and it only made sense towards the end. So that book was the worst book that I have ever read in my life.

So I would not recommend this book unless you like mice killing books.,Negatif
"Abduction: I am an avid Robin Cook fan and found this book to be a great disappointment. Getting past the fact it was not a medical thriller, it just wasn't well written.

I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy.",Negatif
"Piece of Junk: I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product. I have gone through 2 DI-624. DSL and Cable Modem (Road Runner). It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL. From reading another review, its true that the firmware updates are what kills this router. Each update creates new problems. Everyone tells me to use Linksys and I am getting one now... PS I have used D-Link for over 3 yrs!",Negatif
"Did Not Work: I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark, at least with me. The characters where out of a bad 1950's B movie and this lack of character depth plus the far fetched story did not get enough credibility with me. There are many other books out there that a much better, reread a Clancy if you can find nothing else.",Negatif
Reader beware your in for the dull trip of your life!: This is one book that you shouldn't even spend the light of day to even read. The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep. I had to read this for school and didn't think the beginng was so bad but then I hit the bad spot it was the worse thing I ever read. It has its good points but few of them. Just don't waste your time on this.,Negatif
Not at all what I was expecting!: I have watched the first series that came out on television. The first Christy was amazing to watch and share in the lives with the characters on screen or in the book. But after they found a new Christy to play the part in the continuing stories on dvd it all went down hill. It does not have a clear picture and the people that play in it are not relaxed or do well in their parts.,Negatif
"horrible book!: This is a useless book for self-study. It uses an outdated romaji system (""iti"" instead of ""ichi""), but worse of all, it doesn't tell you how to properly read each kanji when placed in a compound! Since each kanji can be pronounced a dozen ways, this book doesn't tell the reader which readings to use in a particular compound, and the reader will be left clueless, if not completely misguided. Avoid!",Negatif
"Boring story line & poor acting: Corbin does a miserable job of acting in this one. If you like gore, there is plenty of that in this film, but if you prefer scary movies to contain interesting story lines and reasonably decent acting, you may want to look elsewhere for your entertainment. If you are going to actually buy a DVD, there are better films available here on Amazon. Rent this if you must, but don't buy.",Negatif
"Disappointed in product quality and support: After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also.",Negatif
HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!,Negatif
"Not worth it: Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it.",Negatif
"Sorry I bought it.: Less than three months after purchase, it's in the shop; an authorized repair center. Picture started ""snapping"" 'till no more picture. They replaced the picture tube and something else. I took it home. Then, it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen. They've been working on it for a week ...",Negatif
"Makes too much noise!: The sounds that the frog makes are very ""tinny"" and it is hard to understand what he is saying. I need to look at the letters/picture buttons in order to understand the corresponding sounds. Although this toy turns itself off, all you need to do is touch it or have something bump into it for it to go back on again. Needless to say, it is a very annoying toy and I see little educational value.",Negatif
"taking stupid to a new hight: this movie makes the orignal max smart a genius. did not even make it half way through the movie before having too stop watching due to way too much stupidityIf it wern't for Anne Hathaway (t.n.a.) and the Rock. Now I like goofy movies, but this went a little past that point. RENT FIRST before buying. who knows, maybe it will be better the second or third time I try watching this movie",Negatif
"This has got to be the worst batman movie ever.: Batman Returns is just plain sick at times. The Penguin, who used to be almost loveable in the original comics, is a homicidal nutball in the movie. The catwoman (who is in herself at times very disturbing.) is blond (she is supposed to be raven haired) and more of a pain to watch then anything else. The only redeeming value is the occational funny line from Penguin.",Negatif
"Yawwwwwn: I am probably not the person to review this movie. I think Billy Crystal has about as much acting talent as a ball of lint. No human male actually acts like that, but, hey, it's only a movie. A ""chick"" movie! I did not laugh once. This was supposed to be a comedic love story, wasn't it? Well, it wasn't. If you are female, you will love this flick. If not, find an excuse, any excuse, not to see this movie.",Negatif
"Bring back the Theatrical Release: I saw the original theatrical release of Blade Runner and was dismayed years later to learn that the director's cut omits Harrison Fords narrative. Why was the narrative removed? I don't get it.... I want to buy a new, high quality DVD based on the original Blade Runner release where Harrison Ford narrates.... To me, the movie just isn't the same without the narrative sound track.",Negatif
"Disappointing book from Berg, usually a wonderful writer: Berg has never let me down before, but this book did. Nicely written, but plot was too pat, altogether too predictable. Neither Patty nor her friends and family seemed real to me. I can certainly empathize with Patty, being childless myself, but this novel was much too simplistic. Berg can usually nail a feeling or sentiment exactly, what happened this time?",Negatif
Torturous: I feel Roger & Me was one of the most important films made about the crime that corporate America committed and is still committing against the working class. Now Moore is becoming a caricature of himself. The blue-collar look that worked well for Roger & Me is clearly phony facade. Moore's cynicism and just plan meanness at times has no home in working class America. It is liberal Hollywood all the way.,Negatif
"Time NOT well spent: If I could rate this a quarter star I would. Catchy title and cute cover: only polite things I can say. It lacked character and plot development needed to sustain an audience, among other things. We get it, Miranda is a monster - can't that be said in under 368 pages???I actually felt it to be a huge waste of time and am so glad I borrowed it from the library rather than waste my money as well!",Negatif
"CDs don't work on XP: My son had these programs for our OLD computer (Windowns 95) and loved them but his disks wouldn't load on the newer computer (XP) so we ordered new disks--I told him these probably won't work either--and they do not work on XP. Does anyone still have a Windows 95 machine in in operation? These are GREAT games, excellent, but will not work on XP. The disks arrived well sealed and good quality.",Negatif
"Frisbees or Coasters: I looked for reviews of these, and found I am not the only one having problems. I have used about 10 so far, and they are generally recording fine in iTunes. The problem is that my car stereo will not read them. The stereo works just fine with other brands of CD-R, but these just spin and spin until I get an error message. Next time, I will go back to the HP CDs and wait until they go on sale.",Negatif
"Informational and imaginative but not captivating: The detailed description of convent living in the 1950s was informative and educational. Curiosity alone should encourage people to buy this book. But for the true romantic, it might be a disappointment. I felt as if Spencer was holding back in developing this romance in order remain respectful. With this purpose in mind, perhaps the subject was too close to heart.",Negatif
"Doesn't work for 2007 Mustang: Double-checked both on Ford's website as well as here on Amazon prior to ordering (both claim it is compatible), but this fuel cap does NOT fit my 2007 Mustang!

"Watch It Only For Connery: Entrapment is too mediocre to be enjoyed. Connery is it's only saving grace. The plot is weak, the action is subdued, and Zeta Jones has no acting ability. Ving Rhames makes a few scenes good, but Will Patton is miscast. This film has nothing that makes other caper films good. No suspense, no style, and no plot seriously hurt this film. If you want a better heist film, watch The Hot Rock.",Negatif
"This is being re-released Oct. 17th 2006....: by Warner BBC. They usually can be counted on for a decent transfer. This is an altogether wonderful 5 star film deserving of a DVD transfer better than this version.

"SAMS Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days: I am finding this book to be next to worthless. I knew nothing about Java prior to acquiring the book and my knowledge base has not expanded much since. I bought this book because I want to write Java Applets for incorporation into webpages. Every example in the book that I've tried either does not compile, uses deprecated methods, or simply does not work. Don't buy this book.",Negatif
"setting?: I had heard about this book that the plot was slow, but it was a good book anyway because the setting and the ""world"" the characters are placed in was so good. Personally, I couldn't see anything special in the setting. It reminded me of the setting in almost every other fantasy book I've ever read. This is not because other authors used Tolkien's ideas, it's simply that it's not a very imaginative world.",Negatif
"There's something about Mary--Something foul about Mary!: This movie starts out with a lot of promise, with lots of laughs, but by the second half-hour, one is just clamoring for it to be over. It's an extremely uneven movie (although it must be noted that none of this is Cameron Diaz' fault, who does the best she can despite a poor script). The movie is a bore, and a waste of time. What a silly movie- just skip it!",Negatif
Does not work as effectivly as advertised: Our yard was infested with Yellow jackets. After installing 6 of these with the better separately sold attractant we watched yellow-jackets fly around these traps for days without having any more then 3 or 4 actually enter the trap. After the full 3 month term of the attractant we used the trap maybe captured 30 to 40 bees out of what we perceived as hundreds flying around.,Negatif
"1001 Spoilers: If you hate reading spoilers, don't read about any movie in this book unless you've seen it already. Duralde gives away FAR too much in his synopses, which are in my opinion completely unnecessary anyway. It is his commentaries that are the interesting element here, and motivate us to see the films. Why he chose to reveal plot turns, and thus needlessly deflate our enjoyment of the films is beyond me.",Negatif
"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS BUT THEY MESSED IT UP!: This TV show is a GREAT SHOW, but do not buy these DVD's because they cut a LOT out. No smoking joints, no tooting lines to account for the little trysts these ladies go through.

Hines Ward Replica jersey: First off I'll say it was my fault for not reading the details carefully enough. I had just ordered a Premier style jersey with the stitched letters and numbers and loved it. This Hines Ward replica jersey was the screen printed version with the mesh type fabric to let in air. Not a 'bad' jersey but not at all what I was looking for. I had no issues returning the item and getting a refund.,Negatif

"Corelli not subtle: This is not subtle singing from Franco Corelli. Wonder what years of pushing the voice will do? Watch this and find out. The voice is heavy. The high notes are achieved by sheer force of will -- sometimes just by sheer force, period! Tebaldi, goddess that she was, is well past her prime.

how does this get on a romance shelf?: This book is so full of rape and violence I wonder if it wasn't written by a man using a pen name. The main character gets brutally raped and then has sex with her husband in front of a group of people like in a bad porn movie. I felt like I needed a bath after this. How does this stuff ever get published as romance which is supposed to be love? Gross porngraphic and disgusting,Negatif
